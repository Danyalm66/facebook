Yet on Election Day 2016, South Carolina alone recorded nearly 150,000 attempts to penetrate its voter-registration system, according to a post-election report by the South Carolina State Election Commission.
If hackers were that persistent against a state that Trump won comfortably with 54.9 percent of the vote, it seems likely they targeted political swing states even more.
So what is the Trump administration doing to prevent even more hacking in 2018 and in future presidential elections? Nothing. Nada. Zero. Instead, its conducting a sham investigation of voting fraud by Hillary voters, under the auspices of Trumps trumped-up commission on voting fraud.
What is the Republican Congress doing about it? Nothing. Instead, its trying to tamp down public concern about Russian meddling.
What are the states doing about it? A few are investing in more secure voting systems, along with ballots with paper trails that can be checked. Most states are doing nothing.
Hello, people? Our democracy has been attacked, and its likely to be attacked even more belligerently next year. This is the biggest immediate threat to the future legitimacy of United States government, yet for all the concern emanating from Republican in Washington youd think nothing had occurred.

Let me give you some numbers.
Eight hundred and sixty-eight. Thats the number ofthe number fewer, that we had 868 fewer voting sites in the black and brown community in 2016, black, brown and poor community.
Twenty-two. Twenty-two states passed voter suppression laws since 2010. Thats where 44 senators were represented, over nearly 50 percent of the United States House of Representatives. And at least 16 or 17 seats in the Senaterather, in the House, probably would not be where they are partisan, if it was not for voter suppression.
Today is 1,562 days1,562 days since the Supreme Court gutted Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Now, Strom Thurmond only filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 57 for one day. This Congress, under McConnell and Ryan, has filibustered fixing the Voting Rights Act for 1,562 days. We talk about Trump winning in Wisconsin by 20,000 or 30,000 votes. There were 250,000 votes suppressed in Wisconsin. In North Carolina, we had over 150 fewer sites doing early voting.
So it is amazing to me that were having a conversation about Russian hacking, but were not having a conversation about racialized voter suppression, which is systemic racism, which is a tool of white nationalism, which is a direct threat to our democracy.""

Putin of Russia twice about election meddling during their first face-to-face meeting last week but did not dispute Moscows claim that he had accepted Mr. Putins denial of involvement, as he declared it time to move forward in a constructive United States relationship with Russia.
Mr. Trumps account, in a thread of morning Twitter posts, of his lengthy and closely scrutinized closed-door meeting with Mr. Putin was an attempt to move beyond the controversy after Moscow characterized the election discussion as a meeting of minds rather than a showdown between the two leaders.
Mr. Trumps tweets, though, did little to dispel that notion. He characterized his position as an opinion and asserted that he was prepared to team with Moscow  which United States intelligence agencies say carried out a historic effort to interfere with American democracy last year, and will attempt to again  on forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit to thwart future breaches.

The petition argued that the election should be nullified due to Russian interference and a new election be held. They further argued that other countries whose elections were interfered, held new elections. They pointed out that the 2016 congressional seats awarded should also be nullified. Because of the electronic hacking, the United States should now vote via paper ballots only and abolish the archaic electoral college. The popular vote should prevail. And, what about all those GOP gerrymandered districts that the Supreme Court just struck down and the illegal crosschecking?? Revote should reopen docket number 16-907 to nullify the 2016 election.

If Donald Trump was thinking that his Thanksgiving holiday weekend couldnt get any worse after Michael Flynn revealed hes cutting a Trump-Russia deal, things have indeed found a way to get even worse. An infamous Russian hacker, believed to be near the center of the Trump-Russia election hacking scandal, is being extradited to the United States so that the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller can have their way with him.
The Czech Republic has ruled that Russian hacker Yevgeny Nikulin will be extradited to the United States, and not returned to Russia, according to a new report from Radio Free Europe (link). Nikulins attorney has revealed that the FBI believes Nikulin was involved in Trump-Russia election hacking. Mueller has jurisdiction over the FBI in all matters relating to the Trump-Russia scandal, which means that Nikulin is now all his.
So now, even as Robert Mueller is gaining Michael Flynn as a cooperating witness with valuable information about the Trump campaigns sign of Trump-Russia collusion, hes also gaining a hacker with insider information on the Russian side of the collusion. There is no guarantee that Nikulin will cut a deal once he arrives in the United States. But assuming he doesnt want to spend the rest of his life rotting in an American prison, its likely that hell work something out with Mueller and spill his guts.
To give you an idea of how much value the United States government places on the cooperation of Yevgeny Nikulin, it had him arrested on an Interpol warrant more than a year ago  before election day  and has been trying to get him extradited ever since. The timing of this extradition ruling appears to be coincidental to Michael Flynns decision to cut a deal. It simply means that Donald Trumps luck  and his future prospects  are growing dimmer by the hour.",,,,,,,," Quebec, Quebec",,

Defense lawyers are taught that they are free to make two contradictory arguments: (1) my client didn't do it, and (2) he made him do it. Convincing a jury of either claim is sufficient for acquittal. The risk, of course, is that if you argue both, you'll lose credibility.
Many, indeed most, defenders of Russia and Putin likewise make both arguments, and likewise undermine their credibility. So on the one hand the United States, abetted by its subservient Western allies, has driven Russia into a corner, and Russia is just pushing back, doing to the West what the West has been doing to Russia. On the other hand, they deny most or all of that pushback, including the Russian very large and long-standing role in destabilizing Ukraine in the lead up to and during the Maidan events; its involvement in the shooting down of MH-17; Russia's deliberate provocation of Georgia in 2008; it's active measures in the West, including the assassination of Litvinenko; and its state-organized hacking, information offensive, and electoral interference.
I am somewhat sympathetic to the ""he made me do it"" argument, in that my belief is that the West has ""mishandled"" (the term I always use) Russia since the end of the Cold War (although I also think that, like most countries with victim narratives, most of Russia's fate has been and remains in the hands of Russians, not outsiders).
I find the ""Russia didn't do it"" arguments, on the other hand, almost always unconvincing and often ludicrous. Those denials in turn undermine any legitimate claims Russia defenders have about the West ignoring Russia's political and especially security interests.",,,,,,,,,,

Trumps pick for national security advisor, Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29. That was the day the Obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the Russian attempts to interfere in the U.S. election.
What did Flynn phone? The campaign says it was to set up a call between Trump and Putin. If so, why was it so important to do it then? The most obvious answer is Flynn sought to reassure the Russians that the Trump administration would reverse the Obamas measures. But no incoming administration has the authority to do such a thing. The Logan Act bars U.S. citizens from correspondence intending to influence a foreign government about disputes with the United States.
Besides, Putin helped Trump win the election. And if Trump or his staff had a role in that, its treason. Flynn has close Russian contacts. He flew to Moscow last year to attend a gala banquet celebrating Russia Today, the Kremlins propaganda channel, and was even seated at the head table near Putin.

The larger significance is its apparent connection both to Russian operatives and to the American alt-right -- the same network that may have helped deliver the U.S. presidential election to Trump.
Le Pen has been an outspoken advocate of pivoting Frances foreign policy toward Putins Russia, and she met with Putin two months ago in Moscow. For years, Le Pen has benefited from Russian financial support and from favorable coverage in state-run Russian media.
Analysts have determined that the social-media campaign following the data dump originated in the United States, in a well-known network of alt-right Twitter accounts. Ben Nimmo, a research fellow with the Atlantic Councils Digital Forensic Research Lab, said in an interview that the subsequent #MacronLeaks Twitter storm  notably in English, not French  largely began with the account of Jack Posobiec, a Washington-based correspondent for the alt-right website TheRebel.media. Posobiec has written that he served, in 2016, as Special Projects Director of Citizens for Trump, the largest Trump grassroots organization in the US.
From there, Nimmo said, news of the Macron leaks was retweeted by William Craddick, another alt-right activist known to have spread in December a fake news story about German Chancellor Angela Merkel tolerating Islamic State terrorists to deploy an E.U. army to subdue her country's neighbors. Eventually, Nimmo added, the ""#MacronLeaks began to be retweeted by well-known National Front accounts  reaching 47,000 tweets in just three hours.
This group of alt-right American activists have been gathering on sites like 4chan and Discord -- sites previously used to coordinate support for Trumps presidential campaign.
Hopefully, Macron will win tomorrow's election in France. But there's a larger issue here. It appears that Western democracies are under attack from Russia and the alt-right in America. It is critically important that U.S. intelligence agencies, working with Interpol and other international intelligence, get to the bottom this.

James Comey was (until today) the Director of the FBI. A Republican appointed by Barack Obama in 2013. He made a lot of enemies in the Democratic Party when, 11 days before the 2016 election, he re-opened investigation into Hillary's emails.
Turned out nothing interesting was in those new emails, and also that this probably did result in Hillary losing the election. Kinda uncool. Also turns out, he did not announce that the FBI was looking into links between Trump's campaign and the Russian Government.
It is clear (though some still argue) that Russia actively worked to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election. They did this by hacking and releasing information on Hillary Clinton, and by creating and promoting incendiary and false news stories online.
The Obama Administration knew about this and got real mad at Russia, basically kicking all of their diplomats out of the country and creating new sanctions.
There are two main concerns that the FBI (and other agencies, including congress) have been looking into.
1. Whether the Trump campaign was in communication with the Russians before or after the election to say that the Obama sanctions wouldn't last.
(This would be bad. Basically actively working against the existing government of the United States, which is illegal.)
2. Whether the Trump campaign actively worked with the Russians to time the release of negative information on Hillary Clinton.
(This would be even worse. Both could be considered treason.)
A number of people in Trump's campaign and also his current team had conversations with Russian diplomats and lied about it. This includes Mike Flynn, who definitely violated the law and who was fired for lying to VP Pence about it. It also includes Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who agreed that he would not be involved in the Russia investigations because he lied under oath about it.
The FBI has had an on-going investigation into this stuff the whole time, and James Comey has been leading that investigation.
Quick note, a Grand Jury is a citizen panel that decides whether there's enough evidence to try a case. These are usually secret, in order to protect the people who might not be even brought to trial, much less found guilty. But sometimes they need to gather information, like documents or testimony. And they do this with court summonses called subpoenas.
Well, yesterday, CNN reported that a Federal Grand Jury investigating Mike Flynn and the Trump Campaigns ties to Russia exists. That Grand Jury has issued subpoenas for more information, indicating to experts a high level of seriousness to the investigation.
It's pretty clear that Trump campaign knows about this, and as it's a Federal case, it was likely overseen by the FBI director, James Comey.
Suddenly, just before that story came out, the Trump team decided that Comey's treatment of Hillary's emails was bad, and fired him. The recommendation to fire Comey came from AG Sessions, who, again, recused himself from the Russia investigation after lying under oath. To be clear, both Sessions and Trump have previously praised Comey at length for his treatment of that investigation.
The response from Dems and also many Reps has been shock. It is very concerning for a President to fire someone who is investigating him. This seems to have happened very quickly. Comey found out he was fired the same time as everyone else, the letter Trump wrote to him was delivered to DC, but Comey was in Los Angeles at the time. Of course, the Deputy Director of the FBI is now in charge, but Trump has the job of appointing a new director, and has not made any sign that he has a list of candidates.
This seems the sort of thing that most congressional lawmakers, who have a mandate to check the power of the President, should be very worried about. Many are calling for a Special Prosecutor, who would be free to work without congressional approval, to be appointed.
Others want broad, unanimous support for Comey's replacement, which would ensure someone who is not under Trump's thumb.
The power to grant these things lies with congress. A congress that is controlled by the President's party, but not by the President.
And that is where we are. It is pretty convoluted, thank you for taking the time to read.
The controversial points in this are:
1 Whether the Russian government hacked Hillary's emails (many Republicans say there is no proof while every intelligence agency in the US said that it was orchestrated by the Russian government.
2. Whether Jeff Sessions lied under oath or if he just misspoke or forgot that he had met with Russian officials. In any case, he agreed to remove himself from the congressional investigation.
3. Whether the Trump Campaign investigation was the cause of Comey's firing. The stated reason is that Comey ""lost credibility"" and damaged the reputation of the FBI by mis-handling the Clinton email investigation.

As a long-time supporter of President Obama, as someone who respects Lisa Monaco and her long service to our country, and as a candidate in the 2016 election, I believe we must re-examine the response to the Russian interference in our election and learn from it to make sure it never happens again. I dont believe that nothing was done, its just that it wasnt enough and in a timely and appropriate manner befitting the assault that was taking place against not just a political party or a candidate, but against the United States of America.
This article suggests that the Obama administrations response was miscalculated on three fronts:
They sought bi-partisan consensus to respond to the attack:
Our democracy was directly attacked by the Russians and this administration didn't respond in a timely manner in part because they couldn't find bi-partisanship? What about the last 8 years made them think bi-partisanship could be found on any subject - especially just months before an election. Did they really think bi-partisanship could be created against Russian electoral interference when the Republican presidential nominee and staff were actively encouraging it and their down ticket candidates were benefitting from it? Sen. Feinstein and Rep. Schiff made the right call for issuing a condemning statement - even over White House objections. Would FDR or George W. Bush have waited until bi-partisan consensus was created before responding to the attacks on Pearl Harbor or of 9/11?
They didnt understand the changes in todays media:
To point out that the joint statement released by intelligence heads on 10/7 publicly blaming the Russians for the DNC hack was unprecedented and to think that statement was going to rise above or compete against the fake news being generated by the Russians or even the legitimate outrages against Trump is to grossly underestimate how information and ""news"" was being disseminated and received in the 2016 election cycle. This appropriate and legitimate statement from our intelligence heads was quickly devalued by purposeful false equivalency and other salacious distractions.
They equated this Russian attack on our democracy to other cyber attacks:
Applying the same timing and operational framework of response to the Russian democracy hack as we did to previous foreign led DNS, IP or industrial cyberattacks was wrong. This was a real-time attack with the purpose of directly discrediting our democracy and electoral process. Elections are real-time events and do not allow the luxury of a delayed response in a place and manner of our choosing as other types of attacks afford.
We must recognize that our nation has the will and technical ability to face this new threat but it will require new ways of operating and thinking to do so. This can be done with a new sixth branch of military dedicated to cyber protection.
We have a Navy to protect the seas. We have an Air Force to protect the air. We have an Army and Marine Corp. to protect the land. We have a Coast Guard to protect our maritime borders.
The internet is an integral component of our world, country, and our lives.

This is because three rouge nations have tested and even suggested hitting the United States with en Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP) bomb that would certainly kill not only the power grid but fry the copper wires used to transfer electricity into buildings, ect. A second theory, which is plausable, is the system in these areas was hacked as test for a larger shut down of power in the future. Then there are those who say,""No big deal it was just a power outage."" For years I have followed the warnings from experts who say our grid is completely vunerable and needed upgrading - only to be ignored by politicians who are too busy working on re-election. The average American has only 3 days supply of water and food, and an extended outage for over 7 days would cause riots and shortages, especially in any major city. If these random failures continue for the next several weeks, then I believe this is a result of hackers or as some suggest, malware in the actual system that is concealed within the computer programming system itself. Hackers from China and Russia have been ""messing with"" the U.S. grid computers for some time (we know people in the power industry). This will be part of our discussion during the inside information at the Prophetic Summit next week (be sure and plan your trip to OCI early, as there is a lot of road work). This week I will be releasing my new book, The Revelation Generation and the two CDS that are part of our new Manna-fest offer. I will be going for test on Tuesday at a hospitol and we are believing for a good report. I thank all of you that are in agreement with me and especially our partners and OCI family.

--------------------
LONDON/MADRID - A huge cyber attack leveraging hacking tools widely believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency brought disruption to Britain's health system on Friday and infected dozens of other countries around the world, security researchers said.
Hospitals and doctors' surgeries in parts of England were forced to turn away patients and cancel appointments after they were infected with the ""ransomware"", which scrambled data on computers and demanded payments of $300 to $600 to restore access. People in affected areas were being advised to seek medical care only in emergencies.
""We are experiencing a major IT disruption and there are delays at all of our hospitals,"" said the Barts Health group, which manages major London hospitals. Routine appointments had been cancelled and ambulances were being diverted to neighboring hospitals.
Telecommunications giant Telefonica was among many targets in Spain, though it said the attack was limited to some computers on an internal network and had not affected clients or services.
Ransomware is malicious software that infects machines, locks them by encrypting data and then extorts money to let users back in. A Telefonica spokesman said a window appeared on screens of infected computers that demanded payment with the digital currency bitcoin in order to regain access to files.
Rich Barger, director of threat research at U.S.-based security research company Splunk, said: ""This is one of the largest global ransomware attacks the cyber community has ever seen.""
Officials and experts identified the type of malware as 'Wanna Cry', also known as 'Wanna Decryptor'. It exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft's Windows operating system that allows it to automatically spread across networks, which gives it the ability to quickly infect large numbers of machines at the same organization.
It is the first piece of self-spreading ransomware, said Adam Meyers, a research with cyber security firm CrowdStrike. ""Once it gets in and starts moving across the infrastructure, there is no way to stop it.""
The Wanna Cry malware exploits a vulnerability widely believed by security researchers to have been developed by the National Security Agency that was released on the Internet last month by a group known as the Shadow Brokers.
Shadow Brokers said at the time that they obtained it from a secret trove of NSA tools and files that are part of the spy agencys hacking program.
Microsoft issued a patch on March 14 described as critical to users of Windows to fix that vulnerability, which CrowdStrike and Splunk said should protect users from getting infected by Wanna Cry. Organisations or individual users who failed to apply that patch to Windows machines may remain vulnerable to WannaCry.
The NSA and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Andrea Zapparoli Manzoni, a senior manager in the Information Risk Management division of Kpmg Advisory in Italy, said: ""The ransomware attack is happening in a haphazard fashion and is hitting every country in the world, including Italy.
""This particular ransomware contains a vulnerabilty, called Eternal Blue, which was developed in U.S. intelligence circles and was then stolen. That gives you an idea about why the level is risk is particularly high. The aim isn't to hit any specific country but to strike as widely as possible to make money.""
Hospitals were a prime target, Manzoni said, because ""they are very vulnerable to cyber attacks and ready to pay because they cannot afford any shutdowns.""
SENSITIVE TIMING
The chaos in Britain's health system came less than four weeks before a parliamentary election in which national security and the management of the state-run National Health Service (NHS) are important campaign themes.
""This was not targeted at the NHS, it's an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said.
""We're aware that a number of NHS organisations have reported that they've suffered from a ransomware attack,"" May said. ""We're not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised.""
Authorities in Britain have been braced for possible cyberattacks in the run-up to the vote, as happened during last year's U.S. election and on the eve of this month's presidential vote in France.
But those attacks - blamed on Russia, which has repeatedly denied them - followed an entirely different modus operandi involving penetrating the accounts of individuals and political organisations and then releasing hacked material online.
In Spain, the attacks did not disrupt the provision of services or networks operations of the victims, the government said in a statement. Still, the news prompted security teams at large financial services firms and businesses around the world to review their plans for defending against ransomware attacks, according to executives with private cyber security firms.
A spokeswoman for Portugal Telecom said: ""We were the target of an attack, like what is happening in all of Europe, a large scale-attack, but none of our services was affected.""
Although cyber extortion cases have been rising for several years, they have to date affected small-to-mid sized organisations, disrupting services provided by hospitals, police departments, public transportation systems and utilities in the United States and Europe.
""Seeing a large telco like Telefonica get hit is going to get everybody worried. Now ransomware is affecting larger companies with more sophisticated security operations,"" Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer with cyber security firm Veracode, said.
The news is also likely to embolden cyber extortionists when selecting targets, Chris Camacho, chief strategy officer with cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, said.
Now that the cyber criminals know they can hit the big guys, they will start to target big corporations. And some of them may not be well prepared for such attacks, Camacho said. In Spain, some big firms took pre-emptive steps to thwart ransomware attacks following a warning from Spain's National Cryptology Centre of ""a massive ransomware attack.""
Iberdrola and Gas Natural, along with Vodafone's unit in Spain, asked staff to turn off computers or cut off internet access in case they had been compromised, representatives from the firms said.
It was not immediately clear how many Spanish organizations had been compromised by the attacks, if any critical services had been interrupted or whether victims had paid cyber criminals to regain access to their networks.  Reuters

""Liberals in my life keep asking me when Im going to stop picking on the Democratic establishment and start helping them beat up on Trump. Lately Ive just been replying along the lines of, Uhh, maybe when you people stop acting like stark raving lunatics? When you reverse your lycanthropic transformation into a bunch of red-faced Joe McCarthys and become the sensible good-hearted people I used to think you are? When you stop acting like a return to Cold War-era tensions with a nuclear superpower is somehow preferable to addressing the horrific injustices unveiled in the WikiLeaks documents? You guys live in a country with a political system that cannibalizes any candidate who looks like they might actually help the ninety-nine percent and youre asking me when Ill join the vast legion of commentators already relentlessly criticizing Trump?? This is nuts. Youre nuts. I need whiskey.
So far, though, theyre only getting crazier. The other day I wrote an article where I pointed out that the way corporate media keeps deliberately marrying the words election and hacking is probably going to succeed in making people start believing that the Russian government actively hacked voting machines to flip votes from Clinton to Trump. I wasnt aware of this at the time, but a mid-December YouGov poll had already found that half of Clinton voters believed that to be the case, answering true when asked if Russian hackers tampered with vote tallies to help Donald Trump. This was before news outlets really started ramping up on that particularly insidious psy-op in response to Obamas new sanctions; AFP recently ran a story where the headline actually called it vote hacking, so theyre getting even bolder now.
It is not an accident that liberals believe this. As a result of consistently marrying the words Saddam Hussein with 9/11, corporate media succeeded in convincing seventy percent of the American public that Saddam was involved in the September 11th attacks in order to rally support for the Iraq invasion. The United States government officially made it legal to conduct psy-ops on American citizens in 2012, so they dont even need to worry about WikiLeaks publishing evidence of government insiders colluding with the media to deceive the public; what they are doing is now completely legal. The end of 2016 also saw the dissolution of the board responsible for keeping government surveillance in check and the passage of a new bill to allot funds toward government propaganda, so we can only expect things to get even more Orwellian.""

She asks, what kind of joke were the Republicans laughing and her answer is brilliant: Yes, it was a joke. People laughed. But what kind of a joke was it? Freud thought that jokes are often a way to express ideas and feelings that are normally repressed and that humor is an outlet for improper thoughts. Kant was one of many philosophers who thought jokes were often about incongruity, absurd contrasts and juxtapositions. In that snippet of conversation, both of those theories of humor are in play.
Yes, its improper to suggest that any U.S. politician is, one way or another, a Russian agent. Its especially unacceptable for Republican politicians to suggest that the Republican presidential candidate, as Trump then was, has been somehow paid by Russia. Its ridiculous, incredible. And yet  at that exact moment, it suddenly dawned on some of those in the room that it might be true. And so they laughed, and quickly expressed solidarity with one another: Were a real family here.
Equally, it is incongruous to compare the politics of Ukraine and the United States. Ukraine is a former totalitarian state, corrupt and beleaguered. The United States is a superpower with nearly 250 years of democratic experience. And yet  its clear from the transcript that the hack of the Democratic National Committee has made the members of Congress uneasy, because the similarities between the United States and Ukraine were suddenly so crystal clear. Maybe Russia is financing our populists, financing people in our government to undo our governments in the United States, just like in Ukraine. Maybe Russia is trying to turn America against itself. But thats ridiculous! Absurd! And so they laughed.
The transcript illustrates, brilliantly, why the Trump-Russia link, at once so obvious and so unbelievable, has taken so long to sink in. When Donald Trump entered the U.S. election, he, with Paul Manaforts help, brought Ukrainian politics right into the heart of the American political system. The violent rallies, the vicious online trolling operations, the use of hacked or secret material to discredit opponents  these are the tactics Russia used in Ukraine, and these are the tactics Trump used. Americans were turned against one another, as Ukrainians were turned against Ukrainians. In addition, money may have changed hands, perhaps in the form of real estate deals, but it almost doesnt matter: The visible tactics, the authoritarian tactics, the ones that we could all see, should never have succeeded.",,,,,,,,,,
Congressman Adam Schiff,https://www.facebook.com/9086721830,9086721830,https://web.facebook.com/RepAdamSchiff/photos/a.333775801830.159007.9086721830/10154003259626831/?type=3,"This morning, I was briefed by the leadership of the intelligence community and have reviewed their full report, which carefully documents the Russian hacking of democratic institutions and individuals, and their dumping of documents during the presidential campaign. The report makes it clear that the Russian intervention was directed by Putin himself, and was designed not only to sow discord in the United States, but was also motivated by the desire to help Donald Trumps election chances by discrediting Secretary Hillary Clinton. These conclusions are well-supported by the evidence and the report should put to rest any uncertainty as to Russian responsibility for this unprecedented interference in our internal affairs. As a nation, we must resolve to impose further consequences both public and private that will deter the Russians from seeking to undermine our democracy in the future and the report issued today will inform the thorough investigations that Congress must now undertake to ascertain the extent of what happened and how, and what steps we need to take to protect our government. 
The President-Elects statement that the Russian hacking had ""absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election"" is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense. It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying  which is true  it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to Secretary Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns. The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended. Whether they had a decisive impact on the outcome will never be known and was certainly not the subject of the intelligence communitys analysis, but that they were of great consequence is undeniable.
Today the Congress certified the election. This report should not be taken to re-open the election, but to make sure this never happens again. President-Elect Trump received the same briefing congressional leaders did this morning, and I hope that he acts appropriately in the face of this clear-cut, Russian malicious activity against America. That starts by accepting the facts. The President-Elect must not obfuscate or distract, but deal honestly with the truth of what happened, and will continue to happen in the U.S. and against our allies, unless we put an end to it. Russian influence operations are not only a clear danger to the United States, but to liberal democracies around the world.

The investigating company paid by the DNC now admits false report-- it's conclusion that Russians hacked the DNC computers was not supported by the data found.
The cyber-security firm that everyone is depending on to make the case for Russias alleged hacking of the 2016 presidential election, CrowdStrike, has just retracted a key component of its analysis  but the mainstream media continues to chug along, ignoring any facts that contradict their preferred narrative.
 As Voice of America reports: see Ref(1),
US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has revised and retracted statements it used to buttress claims of Russian hacking during last years American presidential election campaign.
The shift followed a VOA report that the company misrepresented data published by an influential British think tank.
 This retraction pulls the rug out from under CrowdStrikes identification of the hacking group that supposedly broke into the Democratic National Committees server last year.
The Democratic National Committee used the incident to drum up a narrative that the evil Russians were trying to damage Hillary Clinton and elect Donald Trump. Follow the money, folks  and Alperovitchs position with the Atlantic Council, an organization that is assiduously trying to launch another cold war with Moscow.
Remember, the FBI never looked at the DNC servers: they depended on CrowdStrike  which has a $150,000 a year no bid contract to perform security services for the agency  to analyze the forensic evidence. Shawn Henry, CrowdStrikes CSO and head of CrowdStrike Services, is a former assistant executive director of the FBI.
.So if CrowdStrikes analysis of the alleged hacking of the DNC is collapsing, why arent we reading about it in the mainstream media?
Because the media is no longer serving the interests of its readers: it has become the opposition party, intent on discrediting and overthrowing Trumps presidency. It is, as Trump puts it, fake news.
 Meanwhile we are forced to witness the fraud of the House Intelligence Committee conducting hearings, which are predicated on an assumption that has no basis in reality, and has already been debunked. Indeed, Democratic party politicians  and the anti-Trump wing of the GOP, represented by Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham  have invested all their political capital in an obsessive anti-Russian campaign, the goal of which is to make any rapprochement between the United States and Russia impossible.
A fraud is being perpetrated in order to achieve certain geopolitical ends.
The silver lining is that at least the Voice of America is broadcasting the truth-- unless it gets shut down by the deepstate cadre.

I haven't checked each state, but just, as an example, take a look at Oregon..NO ID required AND they always go democrat...
I went through some of the states to see if any required PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP to VOTE. I saw some states need a copy of your utility bill (huh?), some states need a copy of your drivers license (huh?,many states including California give drivers licenses to illegals) some states like Washington, just require you to check a box on your voter registration to say you are a citizen with no proof (huh?) no picture ID if you can't produce one: as acceptable forms of photo ID due to a religious objection (huh?)
proof of residence (huh?) How do any of these show proof of citizenship?
BUT NOWHERE did I see you HAD to have PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP.......a birth certificate would be good, but NOT required but a UTILITY BILL is proof of citizenship????!!!
NOW UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I found that to get a social security check or a passport from the government THIS is what they require:
""Proof of U.S. citizenship must be established when dealing with ALL levels of U.S. government. Documents proving citizenship must be provided when applying for Social Security benefits and when applying for a U.S. passport.""
On that same page I found this: The following will NOT be accepted as secondary evidence of U.S. citizenship:
""Voter registration card
Army discharge paper
Social Security Card""
(see the link below)
SOOOOOOOOOOO, the question is, if you VOTE you are SUPPOSED TO BE A CITIZEN, BUT, A VOTER REGRISTRATION CARD IS NOT PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP!!!
(HUH????)
So, here's what I DON'T understand.:
Why ISN'T proof of citizenship required to VOTE IN ALL STATES?
Why does a utility bill prove you are a citizen?
Why does each state have their own criteria to vote and why aren't all requirements the same in EVERY state in order to vote in a NATIONAL election?
Why are some states, mostly blue states, defying the federal government and NOT want to disclose their voters list...OH, don't give me that baloney that is about privacy...For God's sake, just google ANYONE'S name...forget about privacy....YOU SAY IT'S BECAUSE THE LISTS CAN BE HACKED???? Are you kidding me..they have hacked the VA, TARGET, BANKS, ETC. ETC. and they're worried about a voter list???? Give me a break!
If I ran a state, I would want to make sure that EVERY SINGLE VOTE was from a United States Citizen that's actually ALIVE at the time they voted....I would want there to be a NATIONAL database to make sure their vote was only counted in ONE state...gee how novel...
WHY WOULD ANY STATE NOT WANT THAT!!!
BUT........
THE ONES PUTTING UP THE BIGGEST STINK ARE THE BLUE STATES....WOWOWOW....WHAT A SUPRISE!!!
Sorry, people, but all signs point to the corruption in all politics and the biggest arrow is pointing to the democratic party..They are the ones trying to OBSTRUCT ANYTHING that makes our country safer, better FOR US, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER!!!

""Yesterday I published an article about Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheens use of the phrase an act of war to describe Russias alleged (and still completely unproven) hacking of political elites in the Democratic party last summer. The use of this phrase is most certainly cause for alarm; as weve discussed before, there is abundant evidence that the Democratic establishment has been working with deep state loyalists within the intelligence community to either reignite the Cold War or start a new hot war with Russia. The last time the US government started claiming to have been a victim of an act of war, it invaded two sovereign nations and began the regime-toppling, drone-bombing aggression of the so-called war on terror.
Today the phrase is being used by yet another official, this time by the top NATO officer in the United Kingdom. According to The Independent, General Sir Adrian Bradshaw said that the election meddling (the term which has risen to prominent usage because it allows Russias alleged infraction to be expanded beyond the alleged hacking to include the circulation of fake news from Russian outlets such as Sputnik and Russia Today) could be deemed an act of war and trigger the military alliances principle of collective defence, which is NATOs founding treaty that an attack on one member shall be considered an attack on all of them.
Immediately following the 9/11 attacks, long before he was dancing around on the Ellen show as the folk hero of corporate liberals that he is today, Hague fugitive George W. Bush invoked the term an act of war to describe acts of terrorism. The fact that America was deemed to have been on the receiving end of an act of war was used to justify first the endless Afghanistan invasion, then the unforgivable invasion of Iraq which violently snuffed out the lives of a million human beings, as well as a tremendous expansion of American interventionism in the Middle East and a great culling of the Constitutional rights of American citizens. The US government has never institutionalized the use of the act of war accusation without the intention of military retaliations.""

(CNN)Russian government-linked hackers potentially targeted as many as 21 states' election systems last year, a Homeland Security official warned Congress on Wednesday.
None of those systems were involved in vote counting, however.
DHS' acting Director of Cyber Division of the department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Samuel Liles, said that by late September the intelligence community concluded that 21 states ""were potentially targeted by Russian government-linked cyber actors"" with scanning of Internet-connected election systems. Liles did not specify which 21 states he was referring to.
The comments came during a hearing of DHS and FBI cybersecurity officials before the Senate intelligence committee.

Liles said of the 21, a small number were attempted for an intrusion unsuccessfully, ""as if someone rattled the door knob and was unable to get in,"" and in a small number ""they made it through the door.""
But Liles said the intelligence community concluded that a variety of factors ""made it likely that cyber manipulation of the US election system designed to change the outcome of the US election would be detected.""
He added the community has a ""very high level of confidence"" in that conclusion.
A second DHS official, Acting Director of Undersecretary, National Protection and Programs Directorate Jeanette Manfra, backed up Liles' testimony.
""We have evidence of ... election-related systems in 21 states were targeted,"" she said.
Senate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr asked if any evidence votes were changed by these Russian cyber efforts, all three witnesses -- Liles, Manfra, and FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence Bill Priestap -- all said ""no sir.""
The hearing -- which was designed to focus specifically on elections infrastructure and not Russian hacking writ large -- frustrated lawmakers in how little information witnesses were able to share.
Aside from the total number of states, the government representatives would not discuss which specifically were targeted or how many were breached. Manfra said that all ""system owners"" in those states had been contacted about the incidents, but that may not invlude state election officials.
The top Democrat on the panel, Virignia Sen. Mark Warner, repeatedly expressed his exasperation.
""I understand the notion of victimization, but I do not believe our country is made safer by holding this information back from the American public,"" Warner said.
Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich asked Priestap whether the Russians were ""successful"" in their goals, which Priestap earlier outlined as sowing chaos and undermining faith in the election process as well as harming Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and benefiting President Donald Trump.
Preistap responded that observers ""could argue either way.""
""I don't know for certain whether the Russians would consider themselves successful,"" he said. ""In many ways, they might argue that because of the time and energy we're spending on this topic maybe it's distracting us from other things, but on the other hand (what this committee has done) ... in terms of raising awareness of their activities ... in my opinion they've done the American public a service in that regard.""
Heinrich also asked Priestap to explain the concept of an ""unwitting agent,"" and then asked if Trump became such an unwitting agent of the Russians by talking about rigged elections.
""I can't really comment,"" Priestap said after a pause.
""I don't blame you for not answering that question,"" Heinrich said, prompting laughter from the room.
Republican Sen. Tom Cotton brought up that Clinton could also be an unwitting agent for all her blaming of the election loss elsewhere, another comment Priestap said he would not comment on.
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin asked if there has been any result of US sanctions on Russian activity in regards to cyberatttacks.
""They have less people to carry out their activities,"" Priestap said.","Away

Its an odd, creepy Independence Day. On this particular birthday of America we have an authoritarian in the White House, a man who is both unstable, and out of his league. He knows nothing about anything. He's impulsive and angry. And were threatened by another crazy man on the other side of the world with nuclear weapons. Our authoritarian is giving the red carpet treatment to Putin at the G20 summit -- bilateral talk, not a pull-aside, as earlier reported -- and will say nothing about this adversary's interference in our election to help him win and beat his opponent.
Meanwhile, we have this subset of the country, 30 to 35%, who support his violence, his recklessness with cult-like religious fervor. Whether they wholeheartedly support it, rationalize it, excuse it or disapprove of it while still backing him, they are condoning violence and the horrific behavior of a president of the United States.
Whether it be war with another power, or war within  a civil war that could play out in different ways  he is fomenting hate and violence. We need to recognize on this birthday that it is going to get far worse, some things will be dire and irreversible, before it gets better.
But there are more of us  many more  and though theyve tried to get the fix in (Russia hacking, voter suppression, etc., etc.) and continue to try, we are undoing them at many turns and have been successful.

""Not one major media outlet reported that GOP secretaries of state like Handel have been using the infamous Crosscheck program to strip untold numbers of minority and other suspected Democrats from the registration rolls. As reported by Greg Palast in THE BEST DEMOCRACY MONEY CAN BUY, Crosscheck was developed by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach to eliminate millions of non-white voters from the registration rolls. In 2016 some 30 GOP secretaries of state used it to help put Trump in the White House.
Trump has since appointed Kobach to a special national commission on elections. Trump also picked J. Kenneth Blackwell, the former Ohio secretary of state responsible for flipping the 2004 presidential election from John Kerry to George W. Bush. The commission will be a perfect weapon to further enhance the Republican apparatus for stealing elections.
Meanwhile, in their endless fund-raising e-mails and public rantings, the corporate Democrats continue to focus on alleged Russian hacking. They avoid any real attention to the Crosscheck program and other forms of homegrown Jim Crow disenfranchisement that helped cost them the presidency and innumerable seats in the state and US legislatures, giving the GOP a growing iron grip on our government.
They fail to mention that a data analytics firm working for the Democratic National Committee ""accidentally leaked the sensitive personal details of roughly 198 million citizens "" on the web for nearly two weeks."" As Business Insider explained: ""This is what you can use to steal an election.""
In Georgia, Greg Palast has reported in that a grassroots citizens' group recently compiled some 10,000 registration forms for Korean-Americans to vote in the disputed Ossof-Handel district. The completed forms were delivered to GOP election officials, but somehow the names were never entered onto the voter rolls.
When registration activists complained, Georgia authorities claimed to never have received the forms. According to Palast, when the activists told election officials they had photo-copied the forms, the state launched a legal lynching, threatening the activists with criminal prosecution and destroying their voter registration organization.
Those 10,000 disenfranchised Korean-Americans, combined with votes stolen by Crosscheck, could easily have won the first run-off election for Ossof, and the follow-up as well.
This is the third consecutive Congressional election the Democrats have lost since Trump took power. They also just lost one in South Carolina.
Pelosi and company are trying to crow about how close they came in heavily Republican districts, many of which re growing increasingly diverse. But those seats still belong to Trump's Jim Crow GOP. Like Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, the party still refuses to even discuss how these critical elections were stripped with massive disenfranchisement and then, where necessary, flipped by electronic means.
To make matters much worse, the Supreme Court has just upheld partisan election stripping in Ohio, refusing to hear a challenge to Ohio's Jim Crow habit of trashing ballots with minor errors on them.
The process has been perfected by current GOP Secretary of State Jon Husted, who regularly orders that ballots be discarded with tiny variations in details like omitting a zip code, missing a digit in a social security number, writing in legal cursive rather than roman letters.
Like Blackwell before him, Husted swings elections by pitching thousands of provisional, mailed-in and other suspected Democratic votes into the trash on the slightest pretext. The practice was challenged in court by the Democrats and the Northern Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. But the corporatist Roberts Supreme Court has left this electoral lynch process in place.
In essence this marks the death of the Democratic Party in Ohio and wherever else there's a Trump/GOP secretary of state. Popular progressive US Senator Sherrod Brown, for example, will stand no chance for re-election in 2018 in a balloting where Husted can eliminate as many Democratic votes as he needs to flip the seat to the GOP, no matter who they run for it.""",,,,,,,,,,

""On the eve of the most consequential French election in decades, the staff of the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said on Friday evening that the campaign had been targeted by a 'massive and coordinated' hacking operation, one with the potential to destabilize the nations democracy before voters go to the polls on Sunday.
""The hacking, which involved a dump of campaign documents, including emails and accounting records, emerged hours before a legal prohibition on campaign communications went into effect  a prohibition that makes it extremely difficult for Mr. Macron to mitigate any damaging fallout before the runoff election, in which he faces the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
""The hacking immediately evoked comparisons to the United States election, in which American intelligence agencies concluded that Russias president, Vladimir V. Putin, had ordered an 'influence campaign' to interfere with the election to benefit the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump.
""In a statement, the Macron campaign said, 'Intervening in the final hour of the official campaign, this operation is clearly a matter of democratic destabilization, as was seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign.'
""It said that the hackers had mixed fake documents along with authentic ones, 'to sow doubt and misinformation.'""",,,,,,,," Ashtabula, Ohio",,

Happy new year, and congratulations: Two weeks from today, your chosen candidate will be sworn in as president of the United States of America. Here are four of the consequences of that choice you made.
1. Were in an utterly unprecedented position where the President-Elect of the United States appears to value the opinions of Vladimir Putin and the Russian state over the U. S. intelligence services. When Trump was asked last week what he thought about Republican Senator Lindsey Grahams statement that Russia deserved sanctions for their hacking of the election, he replied:
""I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but Im not sure we have the kind the security we need. But I have not spoken with the senators and I will certainly will be over a period of time.""
When President Obama retaliated against the Russian hacking by ejecting their ambassadors, and Putin chose not to respond (likely because hell have his puppet in the White House in two weeks  why spend the energy?), Trump tweeted: Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!
Apparently a lot of you have become big supporters of Vladimir Putin in keeping with the views of your leader. Id like to remind you that Russia is in terrible economic condition, where at least 48 people died last week from drinking bath lotion, because it contained methanol, the only kind of alcohol they could get. The Russian military has swept in and taken over small neighboring states in a clear implicit attempt to rebuild the USSR. Putin routinely has journalists or politicians who disagree with him killed, effectively quashing most dissent; and the reason the Russians are doing all this hacking and subversion is because they can't acquire geopolitical power through actual leadership -- they can just create chaos and take everyone else down. Is this seriously the kind of leader you want our president to admire? The country you want to live in? This is what you voted for?

And Masha Gessen's rules for living in the Russian autocracy: http://www.nybooks.com//trump-election-autocracy-rules-fo/
2. The Republicans are moving quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). Obamacare has been inconsistently implemented, thanks largely to Republican governors and legislatures that rejected its expansion of Medicare, and it has raised healthcare costs for some people while reducing them for others). But its also extended affordable health insurance to millions of people who had pre-existing conditions or fell outside of the traditional employer-driven health care market because they were freelancers or entrepreneurs (like writers, a group dear to my heart). While those people wont lose their coverage immediately  because Republicans wisely fear the electoral consequences of taking away health insurance from twenty-two million people  their accessibility and protections will be weakened, with a replacement plan months away, if one ever comes. (Another reminder: The GOP has had literally seven years to come up with a viable replacement plan, and they still don't have a unified vision here.) A full repeal will cost the United States at least $350 billion dollars, as per the Congressional Budget Office. Oh, but then, the Republicans ALSO passed a rule that, according to Fox News itself, allows them to ignore internal congressional budgetary rules if the repeal is successful and explodes the federal deficit.

http://www.foxnews.com//republicans-agree-on-obamacare-rep

http://xpostfactoid.blogspot.com//the-acas-fate-may-be-det
http://money.cnn.com//economy/obamacare-repeal/index.html
The Republicans also plan to remove all federal funding of Planned Parenthood. While you might cheer this as an anti-abortion measure, in fact, Planned Parenthood already does not receive any money from the government to fund abortions; what they get is reimbursement for basic womens health services, like birth control and breast cancer exams. Taking away funding for those services means that more women wont get the health care they need. (And as the writer Justina Ireland pointed out on Twitter, defunding PP could lead to MORE abortions  and more dangerous, illegal ones  because women wont have access to birth control, resulting in more unwanted pregnancies.)
http://www.cnn.com//paul-ryan-planned-parenthood-obamacare/
3. Next week, on January 11, the Republicans have scheduled the following:
* Trumps first press conference since the election
* Senate confirmation hearings for attorney general Jeff Sessions
* Senate confirmation hearings for secretary of state Rex Tillerson
* Senate confirmation hearings for CIA director Mike Pompeo
* Senate confirmation hearings for education secretary Betsy DeVos
* Senate confirmation hearings for homeland security chief John Kelly
* Senate confirmation hearings for transportation secretary Elaine Chao
* Votes in Congress on multiple key budget measures, including some related to Obamacare repeal
Many of these nominees have not yet produced their full financial disclosure forms or gotten complete FBI background checks. This strategy as a whole seems deliberately designed to overwhelm the media with news and drown out any bad coverage in one area  Jeff Sessions's racist past, for example  with headlines in another area -- the word salad the PEOTUS will likely produce.
http://www.politico.com//senate-confirmation-trump-cabinet
4. On New Years Eve, the Trump Organization took in $420,000 from an event with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, essentially selling access to the president-elect for the benefit of his businesses. (One of the people there was a former convicted mobster named Joey No Socks Cinque. It is extremely hard to be a real-estate developer in New Jersey, as Trump has been, without having to deal with the mob, meaning there's yet another shady group that might have influence over the PEOTUS.) Trump said yesterday that Congress, not Mexico, will likely have to pay to build his wall on the southern border. He still has not released his tax returns, which would offer us the best possible measure of his debts and conflict of interest, nor divested himself from his businesses, so he and his family can continue to profit from government action going forward.
In sum, here at bottom is the song thats been playing in my head ever since the electoral college vote, directed at more or less all of America, especially Angelicas first five lines.

Also it was my birthday and my present to myself was a nap instead of reading legislation.
But now it's Thursday morning--here are some facts about what's happened since Tuesday night:
--The President of the United States of America started today with this two-part post on Twitter: ""I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.....to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!""
Notably, White House Social Media Director Dan Scavino tweeted this about a half-hour earlier: ""#DumbAsARockMika and lover #JealousJoe are lost, confused & saddened since @POTUS @realDonaldTrump stopped returning their calls! Unhinged.""
Once again, these are statements from the President of the United States and the Social Media Director of the White House, about members of the American news media.
--The President of the United States also made this statement yesterday, about a major American newspaper that had published the unflattering (and demonstrably true) story about his fake Time Magazine cover: ""The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!""
Amazon does not own the Washington Post, though Jeff Bezos does privately own both companies. There is no such thing as ""internet taxes,"" though if the president were referring to internet sales tax, Amazon currently collects it from every state that has sales tax. The Republican Party, of which the president is the head, opposes internet sales tax.
It is unprecedented for the President of the United States to essentially threaten a major corporation with federal taxation (accurately or not) in response to negative press.
--Yesterday morning, the president stated on Twitter: ""Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong, I know the subject well & want victory for U.S.""
In the late afternoon, he posted a chart (source unknown) with the statement: ""Democrats purposely misstated Medicaid under new Senate bill - actually goes up.""
This is false. While technically/literally Medicaid spending would incrementally increase over the next decade, inflation of medical costs would in fact result in a reduction of $772 billion in federal outlays for Medicaid per the Congressional Budget Office.
--The AP reported that, per a State Department cable, ""the Trump administration has set new criteria for visa applicants from six mainly Muslim nations and all refugees that require a 'close' family or business tie to the United States...that applicants from the six countries must prove a relationship with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling in the U.S.""
The AP noted, ""Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-laws and sisters-in-law, fiancees or other extended family members are not considered to be close relationships.""
--NBC News reported that, per officials and experts, ""the Trump administration has taken little meaningful action to prevent Russian hacking, leaking and disruption in the next national election in 2018, despite warnings from intelligence officials that it will happen again.""
Meanwhile, the White House is moving forward with its Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, with VP Mike Pence telling members yesterday: ""The integrity of the vote is a foundation of our democracy; this bipartisan commission will review ways to strengthen that integrity in order to protect and preserve the principle of one person, one vote.
Overwhelming and comprehensive data from election experts has shown that, as PolitiFact put it, ""actual instances of voter fraud--such as voter impersonation, ballot stuffing and bought votes--are extremely rare, often unintentional and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election.""
--Per the Washington Post and many other reports, Paul Manafort (Trump's former campaign manager) ""retroactively filed forms Tuesday showing that his firm received $17.1 million over two years from a political party that dominated Ukraine before its leader fled to Russia in 2014.""
Manafort is the second former member of the Trump team to retroactively file as a foreign agent; he shares the distinction with former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.
--As I wrote in the March 30 roundup, EPA head Scott Pruitt took action then to keep the pesticide chlorpyrifos on the market, contrary to the agency's own previous scientific conclusion that it results in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting in those who are exposed to it, and in brain development impairment in children. As I also noted on March 30, Dow Chemical makes that pesticide, and its CEO, Andrew Liveris, was named by President Trump to head his American Manufacturing Council in December 2016.
The AP, citing schedules released via the Freedom of Information Act, reported yesterday that 20 days before Pruitt announced his decision on the pesticide's use on produce (it is already banned for indoor use), he was set to meet with Liveris at an energy industry conference in Houston.
A spokeswoman for the EPA said that Pruitt and Liveris ""did not discuss"" the pesticide.
--Nikki Haley, the US Ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted a smiling photo of herself with the caption: ""Just 5 months into our time here, we've cut over half a billion $$$ from the UN peacekeeping budget & were only getting started.
--President Trump hosted a fundraiser last night for his 2020 reelection campaign and the RNC. The $35K/plate dinner was held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC.
As noted in previous roundups, the hotel is located in government-owned property, the Old Post Office building. Despite conflict-of-interest concerns arising from Trump technically being his own landlord, ""under a restructuring outlined in letters between the Trump Organization and the GSA, profits from the hotel will go to an account of the corporate entity that holds the lease, Trump Old Post Office LLC. The letter does not address what might happen to any profits from the hotel after Trump leaves office, or whether they will be transferred to Trump at that time.""
President Trump's substantial assets and the revenue they generate are currently held in a trust controlled by his sons and attorney. In early April, ProPublica reported that ""in an interview... Trump Organization attorney Alan Garten confirmed that President Trump can withdraw profits and underlying assets from his trust at any time.""
CBS News reported that the press were barred from last night's event after the White House claimed ""logistical concerns.""

In the speech, Trump struck a far more statesman-like tone -- highlighting the long and proud history of the Polish people and the shared commitment to democracy from Poland and the United States. Of course, he was reading from prepared text.
Then he returned to his statement that HE was making NATO countries PAY MORE to fund NATO (which isn't a ""thing""). And he made other rude remarks regarding trade deals.
And, in the news conference that PRECEEDED the speech, He attacked the media as ""fake news."" He refused to say definitively that Russia was behind the meddling into the 2016 election. He attacked former President Barack Obama for ""choking"" when confronted with intelligence regarding Russian hacking.
It sounded just like a campaign event. Bashing Obama. Bashing the media. And, most importantly, continuing to reject the conclusions of the FBI and the CIA that Russia was the prime mover in attempting to meddle in the 2016 election.

By Editorial Board The Post's ViewDecember 30 at 7:01 P
ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT Obamas sanctions against Russia for interfering with the U.S. presidential election came late, his action on Thursday reflected a bipartisan consensus that penalties must be imposed for Moscows audacious hacking and meddling. But one prominent voice in the United States reacted differently. President-elect Donald Trump said its time for our country to move on to bigger and better things. Earlier in the week, he asserted that the whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on.
No, Mr. Trump, it is not time to move on. U.S. intelligence agencies are in agreement about what is going on: a brazen and unprecedented attempt by a hostile power to covertly sway the outcome of a U.S. presidential election through the theft and release of material damaging to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The president-elects dismissive response only deepens unanswered questions about his ties to Russia in the past and his plans for cooperation with Vladimir Putin.
For his part, Mr. Putin seems to be eagerly anticipating the Trump presidency. On Friday, he promised to withhold retaliatory sanctions, clearly hoping the new Trump administration will nullify Mr. Obamas acts. Then Mr. Trump cheered on Twitter: Great move on delay (by V. Putin)  I always knew he was very smart!
For any American leader, an attempt to subvert U.S. democracy ought to be unforgivable  even if he is the intended beneficiary. Some years ago, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned of a cyber-Pearl Harbor, and the fear at the time was of a cyberattack collapsing electric grids or crashing financial markets. Now we have a real cyber-Pearl Harbor, though not one that was anticipated. Mr. Obama has pledged a thorough investigation and disclosure; the information released on Thursday does not go far enough. Congress should not shrink from establishing a select committee for a full-scale probe.
Mr. Obama also hinted at additional retaliation, possibly unannounced, and we believe it would be justified to deter future mischief. How about shedding a little sunshine on Mr. Putins hidden wealth and that of his coterie?
What the U.S. measures against Russia mean for the relationship between the two countries Play Video2:40

The Post's Karen DeYoung looks at the implications of the latest U.S. measures against Russia and its interference in the presidential election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)
Mr. Trump has been frank about his desire to improve relations with Russia, but he seems blissfully untroubled by the reasons for the deterioration in relations, including Russias instigation of an armed uprising in Ukraine, its seizure of Crimea, its efforts to divide Europe and the crushing of democracy and human rights at home.
Why is Mr. Trump so dismissive of Russias dangerous behavior? Some say it is his lack of experience in foreign policy, or an oft-stated admiration for strongmen, or naivete about Russian intentions. But darker suspicions persist. Mr. Trump has steadfastly refused to be transparent about his multibillion-dollar business empire. Are there loans or deals with Russian businesses or the state that were concealed during the campaign? Are there hidden communications with Mr. Putin or his representatives? We would be thrilled to see all the doubts dispelled, but Mr. Trumps odd behavior in the face of a clear threat from Russia, matched by Mr. Putins evident enthusiasm for the president-elect, cannot be easily explained.",,,,,,,," Moscow, Russia",,
The Next President,https://www.facebook.com/250156355094296,2.50156E+14,https://web.facebook.com/2012TheNextPresident/posts/1277545452355376,"It was September 2015 when the FBI first noticed that Russian hackers had infiltrated a computer system belonging to the Democratic National Committee.
It was the first sign that Moscow was attempting to meddle in the presidential election.
Nearly a year later, further reporting and testimony from current and former intelligence officials have painted a portrait of Russias election interference as a multifaceted, well-planned, and coordinated campaign aimed at undermining the backbone of American democracy: free and fair elections.
Now, as FBI special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional intelligence committees continue to investigate Russia's election interference, evidence is emerging that the hacking and disinformation campaign waged at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin took at least four separate but related paths.
The first involved establishing personal contact with Americans perceived as sympathetic to Moscow  such as former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and early Trump foreign-policy adviser Carter Page  and using them as a means to further Russia's foreign-policy goals.
The second involved hacking the Democratic National Committee email servers and then giving the material to WikiLeaks, which leaked the emails in batches throughout the second half of 2016.
The third was to amplify the propaganda value of the leaked emails with a disinformation campaign waged predominantly on Facebook and Twitter, in an effort to use automated bots to spread fake news and pro-Trump agitprop.
And the fourth was to breach US voting systems in as many as 39 states leading up to the election, in an effort to steal registration data that officials say could be used to target and manipulate voters in future elections.
Former FBI Director James Comey confirmed in a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee in March, two months before he was fired, that the bureau was investigating Russias interference in the 2016 election. That probe included an examination of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to undermine Hillary Clinton, Comey testified at the time.
Restrictions on disclosing classified information in an open setting precluded Comey from naming names; but reports surfaced before he testified that certain members of Trumps campaign had communicated with Russian officials in ways that raised red flags.
Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Jared Kushner, and Roger Stone were among those being looked at by federal investigators, reports said, amid the FBI and congressional probes into whether any Trump associates acted as agents of the Kremlin, wittingly or not.
Flynn was forced to resign as national-security adviser in February after it emerged he had discussed US sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, during the transition period. The White House said Flynn resigned because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversation with Kislyak.
It was later reported that the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, had warned the White House in January that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail, because US intelligence knew Pence had publicly mischaracterized Flynns interactions with Kislyak.
Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, worked to advance Russian interests for over a decade. Beginning in 2004, Manafort served as a top adviser to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian strongman whom Manafort is widely credited with helping win the presidency in 2010. Between 2006 and 2009, Manafort was paid millions to lobby on behalf of Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. AP reporter Jeff Horwitz told Fox News that Manafort was ""a gun for hire"" who was willing to work explicitly ""on behalf of Russian interests.""
Carter Page, an early foreign-policy adviser to Trump's campaign, has also become a subject of FBI and congressional investigations. His trip to Moscow in July 2016 raised red flags at the FBI, which was granted a warrant by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor Page's communications on suspicion that he was communicating with Russian officials.
Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser, became a subject of the investigation after US intelligence officials intercepted communications suggesting he had proposed setting up a secret backchannel to Moscow using Russian diplomatic facilities on US soil. Kushner met with both Kislyak and Russian banker Sergey Gorkov in December and failed to disclose it on his security-clearance form.
And Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump, communicated with a self-described hacker, Guccifer 2.0, in August 2016 who US intelligence officials believe was a Russian prop.
Former FBI Special Agent Clint Watts told the Senate Intelligence Committee in May that the Trump campaign itself may have been an unwitting agent of Russia.
Part of the reasons active measures have worked in the US election is because the commander-in-chief has used Russian active measures at times against his opponents, Watts said, pointing to Manafort and Trumps citations of fake-news stories pushed out by Russian-linked entities last year.
[Trump] denies the intel from the United States about Russia, and he claimed the election could be rigged  that was the number one claim pushed by RT, Sputnik News, all the way up until the election, Watts said. Part of the reasons Russian active measures work is because they parrot the same lines.
Indeed, the Trump transition team released a statement in December that appeared to cast doubt on the CIAs findings that Russia had meddled in the election with the specific purpose of damaging Clintons candidacy and swinging voters towards Trump.
These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, the statement said.

""On November 7th, I reported at Heat Street that the FBI had obtained a FISA warrant covering the Trump campaigns ties to Russia. [https://heatst.com//exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-co/]
I reported that the FISA warrant had been granted after an earlier, failed application to the court in the summer named Trump and at least three other men, who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as his media surrogates. Those names, sources said, were Donald Trump, with Paul Manafort and Carter Page (two men that had formed part of Trumps campaign) and Boris Epshteyn, who at the time I reported, the eve of the election itself, had only acted as Mr. Trumps media surrogate. Since that time, Mr. Epshteyn has become a part of government as a Transition Team official and now at the White House and I feel able to be explicit as to the names sources gave me as forming part of the summer application to the court.
It is important to note that the application to FISC made by the FBI in July was denied. The FBI must, by definition, have represented to the FISA court that they believed Trump, Page, Manafort and Epshteyn were either actual Russian agents, or Russian agents of influence, which can be unwitting, as Brad C Moss, a national security lawyer, pointed out in my report for Heat Street.
The application that was successful, in October, named two Russian banks  rather than US persons suspected by the FBI to be agents of influence for a foreign power  as it targets- and was drawn more tightly under the minimization doctrine around money laundering and financial offenses, I reported. But, the FISA warrant explicitly granted the FBI permission to examine the communications of U.S. persons as they related to this money laundering inquiry. I did not report any wiretapping of Trump tower, nor any surveillance; rather, my reporting faithfully reflected the views of my sources that a warrant was granted.
[....]
Mr. Epshteyn has, again, not even been indicted, far less convicted in any court. But IF he is indeed under a top secret investigation and his buddy and Trump lackey Nunes has just discussed both the evidence against him and the fact that he is under investigation, then it is Representative Nunes who needs to be arrested. The House Intelligence Committee should do more than demand that Speaker Ryan remove Devin Nunes as chairman of the Russian hacking inquiry. It should call Nunes as a witness, under oath. Having sat myself on a Select Committee, I know very well that politicians become friends with their opposite numbers. It is hard indeed to turn on a colleague with whom one is friendly. But the Committee must steel themselves to their manifest duty. Removal of Mr. Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee is now a matter of the national security of the United States at the highest level.""",Public Figure,,,,,"205,497","206,809",,,

Donald Trump campaigned on a promise of real change. (Sounds Dutertistic?)
The message resonated with the forgotten men and the forgotten women who apparently did enough to get more than the electoral votes required to elect Trump the 45th President of the United States.
It was one of the most divisive campaigns in recent history. But Trump promises to heal all that. On the eve of his inauguration, he told supporters it is time for us to come together as one united people.
He also made a bold promise: We are going to do things that have not been done for our country for many, many decades.
Going by his campaign slogans and promises, here is what Trumpanomics proposes to achieve:
- Create 25 millions of new jobs over ten years and reverse industrial decline. (Huh? His term is only four years. )
- Bring jobs back to America. Be tough on countries taking away jobs from Americans.
- Bring back American cash parked offshore. (The cash has actually started to return because of the recent increase in FED interest rate.)
- Double economic growth. (He is inheriting from President Obama an economy that is actually on the mend.)
- Renegotiate NAFTA.
- Slap a 45 pct tariff on Chinese goods, a 35 pct tariff on Mexican goods. (and spark and trade war?)
-Make the US military the most powerful in the world. (Marching order from the incoming Commander-in-Tweet.)
-Build a wall to keep off illegal migrants. (Should provide further impetus to the construction industry.)
- Cut corporate taxes from 35 to 15 per cent.
- Cut red tape by 70 per cent.
- Abolish Obamacare.
The question now is will he, or can he, deliver? Those who voted for him believe, or at least hope, that Trump can deliver.
Tens of thousands of Trump believers gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in support of the incoming president. But elsewhere in Washington and across the United States, huge numbers also turned out to protest.
Detractors brand Trumps rhetorics as pure grandstanding. They further lament that millions of Americans were caught up in the lies and promises peddled by Trump. Billionaire George Soros labelled Trump an impostor.
Still, Dow Jones was more upbeat. It responded with a 9 per cent uptick since Trump got elected.
While out-going President Obama was scheduled to go through the motion of presiding over a peaceful and orderly handover of power, other Democrats threatened to boycott the inaugural events.
Not to worry, according to Trump. It is OK.  We need tickets (to the events) so desperately.
As of press time, we have no info on foreign dignitaries who would be attending the inauguration. President Rody Duterte, an avowed admirer of Trump, said he is not attending.
Weeks before the inauguration, the media reported the following news which tend to potentially undermine the incoming President:
1. Alleged Russian hacking of the US election to favor Trump, and 2. Alleged possession by Russia of films and documents which could seriously compromise Trump. The accusations were dismissed by Trump as a total fabrication.
What is the unofficial reaction in Moscow to the inauguration?
An enterprising Russian restaurant owner came up with a new dish - a huge, several-layered hamburger sandwich which he calls the Trump Burger. Depending on which side of the political fence they are on, observers believe that the Trump Burger is truly representative of Trump.
To supporters, the burger is larger than life. Detractors, however, find the burger difficult to swallow.

CLINTON: But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.
This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.
CLINTON: So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.
WALLACE: Well?
TRUMP: That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?
WALLACE: Hold on -- hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control. Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.
TRUMP: So just to finish on the borders...
WALLACE: Yes?
TRUMP: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from.
And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.
Now we can talk about Putin. I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.
He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she's playing chicken. Look, Putin...
WALLACE: Wait, but...
TRUMP: ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.
CLINTON: Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.
TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.
CLINTON: And it's pretty clear...
TRUMP: You're the puppet!
CLINTON: It's pretty clear you won't admit...
TRUMP: No, you're the puppet.
CLINTON: ... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...
CLINTON: And I think it's time you take a stand...
TRUMP: She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.
CLINTON: I am not quoting myself.
TRUMP: She has no idea.
CLINTON: I am quoting 17...
TRUMP: Hillary, you have no idea.
CLINTON: ... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...
TRUMP: And our country has no idea.
CLINTON: ... agencies.
TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.
CLINTON: Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.

VIDEO: Hillary Clinton says she believes misogyny, Russian interference and questionable decisions by the FBI prevented her from beating Donald Trump and becoming United States president.
Key points:
Hillary Clinton going through the ""painful"" process of writing a book about campaign
Vladimir Putin held grudge over her 2012 Russian election allegation, she says
Misogyny ""very much a part of the landscape politically, socially and economically"", Mrs Clinton says
The former Democratic presidential nominee said she took responsibility for the loss and had been going through the ""painful"" process of reliving the 2016 contest while writing a book.
She said while her campaign overcame an ""enormous barrage of negativity, of false equivalency"" but was fatally wounded by Russian leaks and the FBI's eleventh-hour disclosures about her use of a private email server.
""It wasn't a perfect campaign. There is no such thing,"" Mrs Clinton said at the annual Women for Women International's luncheon in New York.
""But I was on the way to winning until a combination of [FBI director] Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off.""
She reminded the enthusiastic audience packed with women that she ultimately earned 3 million more votes than Mr Trump.
""If the election were on October 27, I would be your president,"" Mrs Clinton said.
She also highlighted Russia's role in hacking into her campaign's internal emails and subsequently coordinating their release on WikiLeaks, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin as ""that leader who shall remain nameless"".
US intelligence agencies are investigating whether Russia coordinated with Mr Trump associates to influence the election.
""[Mr Putin] certainly interfered in our election,"" the former secretary of state said.
""And it's clear he interfered to hurt me and help his opponent.""
Mrs Clinton linked Mr Putin's alleged decision to support Mr Trump's campaign to her accusing the Russian leader of rigging his election victory in 2012, when she was secretary of state.
Misogyny 'part of the political, social, economic landscape'
In a question-and-answer-session with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Mrs Clinton said she thought misogyny was also a factor.
""I do think it played a role,"" she said, adding that misogyny is ""very much a part of the landscape politically, socially and economically"".
After two unsuccessful presidential campaigns, Mrs Clinton is not expected to run for public office again.
""I'm now back to being an active citizen,"" she said.","Typically replies within an hour

Theres no question there was a very serious effort made by Mr. [Vladimir] Putin and his government, his organization, to interfere in major ways with our basic fundamental democratic processes, Cheney said Monday during a speech at the Economic Times Global Business Summit 2017 in New Delhi.
In some quarters, that would be considered an act of war. I think its a kind of conduct and activity we will see going forward. We know hes attempted it previously in other states in the Baltics, Cheney said, according to video of the remarks.
Some Democratic lawmakers charged last week that Russias election meddling amounted to an act of war, and others have accused Moscow of attacking the United States through its hacking.
I actually think that their engagement was an act of war, an act of hybrid warfare, and I think thats why the American people should be concerned about it, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian election interference last Monday.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) also said back in December that Russias actions amounted to an act of war.
Still, experts have cautioned against making such accusations. The U.S. government does not currently have a definition of what actions in cyberspace would necessitate a military response.
Cheney on Monday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of having designs on the Baltic states. NATO has recently deployed forces to Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland in the wake of Moscows aggressive activity in Ukraine.
Another aspect of Mr. Putins conduct is the issue that is now very much in the headlines at home, and that has to do with cyber warfare, cyberattack on the United States  the fact that he took his capabilities in the cyber area and used it to try to influence our election, Cheney said.
While the former vice president emphasized that there is no argument that President Trumps election was not legitimate, he said Americans should be mindful of Putins actions.
I would not underestimate the weight that we Americans assign to the Russian attempts to interfere with our internal political processes, Cheney said.
The FBI has been investigating Russias efforts to influence the election, including looking at any possible coordination between Trumps presidential campaign and Moscow, FBI Director James Comey revealed last week.
The intelligence community concluded in January that Russia waged a cyber and disinformation campaign to undermine the U.S. democratic process, damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clintonand aid Trump.","Away

Joe Manchin (D-WV) asked about Russian President Vladimir Putins covert operation to subvert the 2016 election: Prior to [the president being inaugurated]in the campaign up until through the transitionwas there ever any meetings that [Trump] showed any concern or consideration or just inquisitive of what the Russians were doing and if they really had done it?
Sessions replied, I dont recall any such conversation. Im not sure I understood your question. Maybe I better listen again.
Manchin had picked the right guy to ask this question: Sessions chaired the Trump campaigns national security advisory committee, and he was a key adviser to Trump during the transition period (and Trumps designated AG pick). Presumably, Sessions would know if Trump, before or after the election, was seriously examining the Russian attack on the 2016 election.
Machin continued: You were part of the national security team, so if [Trump] wouldve heard something about Russia with their capabilities or concern about what they could do to our election process. Was there ever any conversations concerning that whatsoever?
Sessions answered, I dont recall it.
The implication was clear: Trump and his national security team had not extensively discussedif they had discussed at allthe Russian assault against the United States. This was a damning admission from Sessions.
In the final moments of the hearing, Sessions admitted that the Trump administration did not have an effective strategy to counter cyber threats to the United States. Having asserted that neither he nor Trump had demonstrated any interest in the Russian hacking attack, this statement was hardly a surprise.",,,,,,,," St. Clair, Michigan",,

But, the Times is going to continue shoveling the narrative, only cleverly phrased a different way. Fake news. Subscribe now. Disclaimer... all alleged NYT journalists are on an extended leave of absence during this never ending, suffering edition of post-election ""misdirection theatre"". All articles are being faxed in by the CIA... lather, rinse, repeat.
""The 17-intelligence-agency canard has been a favorite go-to assertion for both Democrats and the mainstream news media, although it was repudiated in May by President Obamas Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan.
So, on June 29, the Times apparently found itself with no choice but to issue a correction stating: The [Russia-hacking] assessment was made by four intelligence agencies  the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. The assessment was not approved by all 17 organizations in the American intelligence community.
This point is important because, as Consortiumnews.com and other non-mainstream news outlets have argued for more than a month, it is much easier to manipulate a finding by hand-picking analysts from a small number of intelligence agencies than by seeking the judgments and dissents from all 17.
Despite the correction, the Times soon returned to its pattern of shading the truth regarding the U.S. intelligence assessment. On June 30, a Times article reported: Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the unanimous conclusion of United States intelligence agencies that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 race.
The Times phrase unanimous conclusion conveys the false impression that all 17 agencies were onboard without specifically saying so, although we now know that the Times editors are aware that only selected analysts from three agencies plus the DNIs office were involved.
In other words, the Times cited a unanimous conclusion of United States intelligence agencies to mislead its readers without specifically repeating the all-17-agencies falsehood. This behavior suggests that the Times is so blinded by its anti-Trump animus that it wants to conceal from its readers how shaky the whole tale is.""

Suppose that plans had been set for a military coup to take over the government. And right away, immediately 50,000 people were killed, 700,000 tortured. A bunch of economists was brought in from Afghanistan, lets call them the Kandahar Boys, who very quickly destroyed the economy, and established a dictatorship which devastated the country.

In the attached article, the author so saliently and profoundly lays out what were facing now, Ive edited it down to his raw points. I urge you to read this:
In its 1987 review of Amerika, The New York Times TV critic concluded, that the United States would simply crumble from within because of national moral flabbiness -- is monumentally implausible. Ironically, it doesnt seem so implausible today.
With the economic argument over communism resolved, the remaining divide with Russia is political: democracy vs. dictatorship, humanitarian internationalism vs. cold nationalism. Access to sausage is not in danger, giving Russia a fresh opening.
American conservatives with a nationalist, and even authoritarian, bent like Donald Trump are not unnerved by the prospect of Russian influence over the U.S. government. Some see common cause with President Vladimir Putin in the war against Islamic militants, shelving concerns about Russias imperial ambitions and comfort with genocidal tactics. Much like how the Russians in Amerika want the United States of America to dissolve, both Putin and Trump have rhetorically undermined the European Union, and Trump has questioned Americas commitment to Putins bte noire, NATO. Weaker global and regional institutions make it easer for individual nations to act with impunity.
Russia isnt popular with most Americans, but Trump supporters did not flinch when he deflected allegations that Putins government murdered journalists. At least hes a leader  I think our country does plenty of killing also, Trump declared. Those in the alt-right movement see Putin as a symbol of white nationalist values. News of how Russia used hacking to manipulate voting behavior has only increased Republican approval of Putin in polls.
Whats even more disturbing is Trumps dismissal of the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion that Russia not only meddled in the election, but actively sought his victoryand then celebrated it. Trumps reaction has been to mock and misrepresent their findings, while blaming the victims for being hacked. His aides scoff at the implication that hes too pro-Putin. Trump himself has had every opportunity to clear up any misconceptions, and he hasnt done it. American presidents have had warm relationships with Russian leaders in the pastReagan and Gorby, Clinton and Yeltsinbut this feels different.
Americans have allowed themselves to become immobilized by their own selfish concerns. Immobilized by a lack of understanding of the freedoms secured by our forefathers into which most of us were born, and now have lost.
Fictional President Bradford in Amerika states, Totalitarianism doesnt need armies. It only needs to control a couple of things: the media, and the ability to dispense privilege to some, and withhold it from others. And of course, a weak and divided people helps.
The seeds of that dark future are already in the soil. Russia executed a subtle control of the mediaweaponizing mainstream institutions through releases of stolen emails and flooding social media with fake news. Fox News is airing uncritical interviews with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, an organization U.S. officials have linked to Russian intelligence. And the American people are not only deeply divided along geographic and cultural lines, but new research shows them to be increasingly dubious about the importance of democracy.
If the dream of democracy cannot survive in America, it cannot survive the 20th century, Milford declared in his announcement address. Part of Putins agenda is to convince Americans that our democratic institutions can no longer be trusted. Our challenge, in the face of Russian interference, is to remind ourselves that despite the deep ideological and cultural differences that are testing American unity, the unifying principle of America remains.
Thirty years ago, a bloated, overwrought TV miniseries tried to make that point and missed the mark. Hysterical prophesizing of totalitarianism can make it easier to shrug off quieter erosions of democracy. But no matter how imperfect, Amerika was more prescient than its creators ever could have expected, reminding us that we can only lose what makes America great if we surrender it ourselves.",,,,,,,," San Jose, California",,

Clapper told CNN that the presidents assertion that other countries may have been in on the hack is news to me.
We saw no evidence whatsoever that there was anyone involved in this other than the Russians, Clapper said.
Video:
When asked if he had any doubts, as Trump does, that the Russians were behind the election meddling, Clapper said, Absolutely none.
He also pointed out that recent Russian behavior  particularly todays news that Moscow is ramping up spying efforts in the United States  is a sign that they are starting to prep the battlefield for the 2018 midterm elections.
Video:
Clapper, who served as the intelligence director under President Barack Obama, added that the Russians will continue to collect intelligence and interfere in U.S. elections so long as the United States, led by Trump, refuses to push back.
Video:
Ultimately, Trumps refusal to stand up to the Russians and his continued effort to undermine the work of the U.S. intelligence community is doing serious damage to the United States.
Instead of retaliating after last years Russian attack on American democracy, Trump has kept his head buried in the sand, likely because he was the chief beneficiary of the meddling.
But as Clapper said on Thursday, This was an assault on us, and it could be a Republican presidential nominee who gets targeted by the Russians next time.","Away

Wednesday night, after most nightly news shows had already aired, after a good portion of the country had already gone to bed, something deeply disturbing was revealed. We learned that a man lied under oath. In this country, we call that perjury, and it's not just a violation of court policy, it's a crime.
Tens of thousands of people have gone to jail for lying under oath. When black folk lie under oath, they often go to prison.
As you may recall, Olympic Gold Medalist Marion Jones went to prison for lying under oath about using performance-enhancing drugs.
In 2005, the rapper Lil Kim went to federal prison for lying under oath.
But 31 years ago, all the way back in 1986, Coretta Scott King warned this nation about the questionable character of a man named Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, III.
At that time, Jeff Sessions was being considered for an appointment as a federal judge, but Coretta Scott King was so disturbed that she penned a 10-page letter detailing why such an appointment would be dangerous for this nation. She questioned his commitment not just to voting rights and civil rights, but to good judgment and common decency.
""Based on his record, I believe his confirmation would have a devastating effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my husband's dream,"" she wrote.
And so, 31 years ago, the United States Senate decided against appointing Jeff Sessions as a federal judge. He never got the position.
Three decades later, he is now the Attorney General of the United States, and was just caught lying under oath.
As you no doubt know by now, something very peculiar is going on with Donald Trump and Russia. His National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, resigned in disgrace, after he was caught lying about his communications with Russian officials  serving the shortest term of any National Security Advisor in American history.
Frequently over the past few years, Donald Trump has said that he knows Vladimir Putin well, that they have a relationship, that they have influence with one another. Now that he is President he denies any such relationship.
It is now widely accepted that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee  and questions linger about Russia's influence on the November presidential election.
That is just one of many reasons why it is so damn disturbing to see Jeff Sessions, who is not Marion Jones or Lil Kim, but now the Attorney General of the United States of America, the top law enforcement official in our country, plain as day, lying under oath during his confirmation hearings.
Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, during the hearings, told Sessions of a news report that surrogates for Donald Trump's presidential campaign frequently met with Russian government officials throughout the campaign.
And with a smug look of confidence, Sessions looked right at Franken and said, ""I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.""
Except he did.
Not years before he gave this testimony, but just months before he gave it, Jeff Sessions, this past July, and again this past September, met with Russian government officials. That he swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth during his confirmation hearing, but then lied twice about meeting with the Russians just months earlier, is not just wrong, it's criminal.
Jeff Sessions should resign immediately. If he does not resign, he should be fired. Then, he should prosecuted for perjury and a full, unbiased investigation into Trump's ties with Russia should be launched. It is suspicious that the very thing Trump's cabinet officials keep getting caught lying about is Russia, but this is not just about Russia, it's about integrity, it's about honesty and fairness.
Coretta Scott King did not trust Jeff Sessions 31 years ago. In voting him in as Attorney General anyway, her words were ignored, but the chickens have come home to roost. Jeff Sessions was a scoundrel then and he's a scoundrel now, as phony as a $3 dollar bill. This controversy will not go away and we all must demand, together, in the spirit of our ancestors, that he be removed from office immediately.

The report found that several of them flat-out did not believe Russia tried to interfere with the election and that they were drawn to Trumps Make America Great Again slogan. One supporter told a Times reporter that if hacking helped Trump win, Im glad they did it.
Their indifference to Putins behavior may be shocking to many of us, but it really shouldnt be. These are the same supporters who back a man who went on a years-long witch hunt to force Barack Obama to produce a birth certificate to disprove he was born in Kenya. Two-thirds of them believe he is a Muslim.

These are the smoke signals rising from those in and around the United States intelligence community over President-elect Donald Trump's dismissal of the evidence of Russian hacking in the presidential election.
And now, in a series of tweets, Mr. Trump has taken the side of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange over the collective conclusion of those tasked with our national security. Assange, in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity (who at this point must be considered a full-fledged propagandist and abetter) said he didn't get the information from Russia. Well if he says so... Let's just use that same standard for all of our adversaries. Nothing to see here. Why waste all these billions of dollars on intelligence gathering?
When it comes to our intelligence services, there must be many caveats. This work is more art than pure science, often picking out clues from a lot of noise. Our intelligence has been wrong in the past. The CIA and other organizations have overstepped their bounds at times, and their findings have been politicized (Iraq). Furthermore there is often a certain amount of dissent about many findings. I also must add that I have long felt we can benefit from taking a long, hard, and critical look at our intelligence apparatus, its structure, bureaucratic interferences, and fiefdoms. But in this case, those concerns are secondary as the agencies seem to be speaking largely in unison with the urgency of real evidence.
I have found the men and women who do these intelligence jobs to be serious about their line of work. Deadly serious. After all, when they are wrong people can and often do die. What do the vast network of people risking their lives undercover and in dangerous locals, men and women whose names we will never know, think of Mr. Trump's cavalier dismissal of their work? What about the thousands more at headquarters using their immense analytical skills in the service of country instead of, say, making millions on Wall Street? We need a robust intelligence force now more than ever. This is a matter of national security. It affects all Americans, and people around the world. Hopefully patriots within Mr. Trump's own party and in his inner circle will step up and tell the incoming president how dangerous this rhetoric is.

He has been busy attempting to delegitimize the election of Donald Trump and undermining the national security of the United States. He hit a new low yesterday when he commuted the sentence of Bradley/Chelsea Manning.
As you may recall, Manning stole and leaked more than 700,000 national security documents and handed them over to Wikileaks, which posted the information online. What Manning stole was so important that Osama bin Laden was obsessed with reading it in order to counter American war strategy in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The Taliban publicly stated that it would use the information to hunt down informants.
Manning was charged with 22 crimes, including aiding the enemy, which carries the death penalty. He pled guilty to ten charges, was convicted on several others and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Thanks to Obama, Manning will be released in May after serving just seven years.
In recent weeks, Donald Trump has been pilloried by the left and even some on the right for supposedly not respecting the men and women in the intelligence community who risk their lives to protect us. Barack Obama just slapped the intelligence community in the face.
Think about this for a moment. During last year's presidential campaign, Obama and the Democrats directed a lot of vitriol at Wikileaks for exposing John Podesta's emails and messages from the Democratic National Committee. Those emails were a mixture of gossip and embarrassing political commentary.
Almost every day since the election we have been told that the hacking of those political documents constituted a constitutional crisis. There has been an effort to undermine Trump's legitimacy. Sanctions were imposed on Russia. Multiple investigations are underway.
The documents Manning released were not gossip. They involved the national security secrets of the United States of America. Even CNN's Jake Tapper was shocked by the blatant contradiction involved in commuting Manning's sentence.
The DNC leak is insignificant compared to the gaping wound that Manning struck to the body of U.S. national security. With this one act, Barack Obama has shown the total hypocrisy of the hair-on-fire controversy we were subjected to regarding John Podesta's emails.
Every congressman and senator who expressed such grave misgivings about whether Russia was involved in the DNC leaks should be outraged over what the president just did in giving a ""get out of jail free card"" to one of the most despicable characters in modern American history.

Allegations of Russian election interference have grown from an inability to provide substantive evidence to corroborate the claim that the Russian government hacked Clinton campaign Chairman John Podestas emails to sensationalizing any link between Trump officials and Russian officials as evidence of a sinister plot to get President Donald Trump elected. The Democratic Party is using the Russian narrative as a public relations strategy so that it can unify its base around the perceived enemy of Russia without having to make any policy concessions that would offend its base or network of donors.
On March 9, BuzzFeed reported that Senate Democratswho chose to remain anonymousare starting to acknowledge that their hysteria over alleged Russian election interference has been mostly political theater. Even some Democrats on the Intelligence Committee now quietly admit, after several briefings and preliminary inquiries, they dont expect to find evidence of active, informed collusion between the Trump campaign and known Russian intelligence operatives, wrote BuzzFeeds Ali Watkins. Among the Intelligence Committees rank and file, theres a tangible frustration over what one official called wildly inflated expectations surrounding the panels fledgling investigation. The mainstream media and Democratic establishment have received immense attention for inflating claims of perceived links between Trump and Russia. This latest report signals that some Democrats are starting to express frustration that there is no evidence to substantiate their hysteria about Russia.
On March 11, The Hill reported that some Democrats in the House are bracing for failure in their search for actual evidence. Several Democrats interviewed are already preparing to blame Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee and threaten to abandon the investigation if they dont like the way its being conducted. Rep. Jim Himes told The Hill, Were certainly not there yet, but this rhetoric provides Democrats with an escape plan when things likely backfire. The Hill also reported that the former U.S. Ambassadors to Russia under former President Barack Obama, Michael McFaul and John Beyrle, have criticized Democrats for conflating diplomatic meetings with the Russian Ambassador to the United States as criminal behavior.
Looking at how these partisans have inflated the allegations, its glaringly obvious that the Russia narrative is just a marketing and fundraising opportunity for Democrats.
Rep. Eric Swalwell tweeted on March 9, Help me connect the #TrumpRussia dots. Submit your tips & well follow the evidence & post online. Join us here. In essence, Swalwell is propagating Trump-Russia connections based on unsubstantiated and biased claims from the partisans who reply to his solicitation, rather than providing his constituents with the information Congress discovers in its investigations.
On the same day, Democratic Party political fundraiser Scott Dworkin tweeted a baseless allegation that Obamacare repeal is a Russian conspiracy. If u were Putin & wanted to kill as many Americans as possiblewouldnt taking away their healthcare do the trick? #trumprussia #russiagate. Despite this tweet being an outrageous, satirical allegation, Dworkins feed has focused on propagating Russia hysteria. Surely, the Russia narrative is proving to be a lucrative fundraising opportunity that has allowed him to elevate himself as a leading purveyor of Russia hysteria.
Though Russia is turning out to be a valuable tool for the Democratic establishment to rally its support base, the partys favorability ratings remain several points below Trumps. Nevertheless, the Democratic Party continues to focus on Russia conspiracy theories rather than policies that could improve the lives of low-income, working and middle class Americans. The Democrats main sticking point in its opposition to Trump is further repelling the thousands of voters that were disenfranchised by Clintons candidacy and the establishments failed status quo approach.

Not that I identify as a Democrat, but here's mine. You're welcome to add yours.
""I'll articulate.
-- The ACA needs to continue, and the parts that are broken need to be fixed.
-- McConnell needs to be removed after vowing Obama would ""get nothing done during his presidency"" on the night Obama was elected, and then impeding hearings on Supreme Court justice replacement.
-- A full investigation into the Russian hacking of our press, our social media, and our election system needs to begin immediately, with full force, as a bi-partisan effort.
-- Everyone, Democrats, Republicans, whatever, needs to grow up and start working for the entire country, not just for the people they agree with, or the people who will line their pockets.
-- Journalists need to take responsibility for their role in this debacle (again, on both sides), and begin defending the country and the free press by citing sources and being accurate about it.
-- Furthermore. Just as laws were eventually passed so that ""advertisement"" had to be at the top of an article that was designed to look like the regular news articles in that periodical - avoiding readers thinking it was legitimate or coming from that periodical - magazines, newspapers, et al that knowingly publish completely fake and utterly provable as fake ""news"" (to wit Obama not being an American citizen) need to be held to account.
-- Magazines such as The Enquirer, whose owners are close friends of Trump's, need to disclose that whenever they publish a story about him, good or bad.
Let me continue.
-- Teachers need to be paid as much as politicians, with as many benefits. Ditto firefighters and police.
-- The police need to be educated about their own failings, as does the general populace.
-- More police need to be given ""street beats"" in smaller neighborhood sectors, so they and the population they serve can get to know one another.
-- -- Teachers, police, firefighters who abuse their power - along with judges and other civil servants - need to be removed.
In addition, arts in the schools need to be funded, DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, the way sports in the schools are funded.
-- And I would continue that rule right through high school graduation, if not community colleges as well. If someone donates $100,000 for football, half of that money should immediately go to funding for music, graphic arts, dance, etc. in that school.
-- Our citizenry needs to hold itself responsible for the appalling lack of understanding and empathy in this country right now, and the arts can go a long way toward fixing that. Because everyone can play in the orchestra, even if it's just the little Downs Syndrome boy in one of my father's music classes, clapping wood blocks together. Not everyone can do sports, but every child can feel a part of something greater than himself or herself through the arts.
-- The educational system itself needs to go back to rote learning at the beginning. There's plenty of time to learn why addition and multiplication work later. First, learn to add and multiply. I don't know anyone from my generation who can't add, subtract, and figure out their change at the grocery. Those are life skills, and we learned them by numbly reciting ""2 plus 2 equals 4. 4 plus 4 equals 8.""
-- Students can't be graded on a bell curve. It doesn't work.
-- There should be as much funding for brilliant children as children in need of extra help, instead of the assumption that bright children will ""always do okay anyhow"".
-- The United States needs to stop borrowing so much. We've created a culture of greed and narcissistic ""more me"", where nothing is ever enough and everyone is entitled to everything. All of us need to take responsibility for that, and all of us need to stop.
-- The laws governing who can contribute how much to elections need to be rolled back. A lot. People like the Koch Brothers shouldn't be allowed to influence elections to this degree. I would add Soros as another example.
-- The minimum wage needs to be raised, by the feds, across the board.
-- The very rich need to be educated in their responsibilities as citizens, and learn that with success comes great responsibility - not just to your share holders, but to your nation. If necessary, they need to be humiliated into giving back, but they must give back.
Let me go even further.
-- There should be a flat tax on everyone, period. All corporations, all religious institutions. They are part of this country, they are making/providing a living for themselves from the efforts of this country, and they need to give back - not just in time and good works (though those are important too, obviously), but in cold hard cash. ----- Deductions should be limited to the most necessary, which to my mind would be medical and ""clearly educational"".
-- I am not talking about someone being allowed to deduct the money they spend sending their child to a private school, whether it's religious, liberal, fringe, whatever. If you want to send your child to a private school well and good, but citizens should understand that their primary obligation here is to improve the educational system and standard for all citizens, not just use their money to improve it for their own children.
-- Children who torture animals or other children should get therapy, and be closely watched for signs that their behavior will lead to horrific crimes as they become more powerful. The laws against torturing or callously harming animals need to be strengthened.
-- The American people need to get over their need to be ""right"" and instead concentrate on the need to lead by example. Again, this goes back to early schooling.
-- Civics classes should be reinstated.
-- World history classes should be mandatory from earliest years on up to graduation.
-- ""Children's services"", which have different names from city to city and state to state, need to be improved beyond measure. Truly competent case workers who are paid a decent living wage need to be in place, and regularly held accountable by their local governments and citizenry to ensure that no child falls through the cracks again.
-- Measures to deal with climate change should be decided by groups of scientists - bi-partisan, international - and the funding provided on that basis, rather than being used as a political football to suit the temper of whoever is in office at the time.
-- Every citizen needs to take responsibility for themselves, and for the state of the country. Not by denigrating others or pushing others down, but by elevating and uplifting.
-- Libraries, and knowledge, need to be celebrated. There is nothing wrong with ignorance, because it can be fixed, but we need to understand that it does need to be fixed.
-- Every American child should have to spend a year doing ""good works"", with no exceptions, at the nation's expense. I'd prefer they live abroad for a year, because America is too insulated from the rest of the world, but that might not be possible. If not, ""good works"" could be any sort of non-partisan effort. Cleaning the national parks, reading to the blind, volunteering for the jobs no one else wants or has time to do.
-- I would add that these good works should specifically not be in the child's own community, or part of their own religious preference, since a lot of the point here is to broaden everyone's outlook and introduce them to people who don't believe as they do.
-- Most of all, kindness needs to be rewarded, from birth, in the form of community and personal praise, and people who practice cruelty, vindictiveness, spitefulness, need to be shunned until their behavior changes.
That's my two cents. I'm sure I've left out a ton of things, but at least it's a start.""",janisian.com,Musician/Band,Impressum,,,"484,080","519,012",,,
"Hillary Clinton, The People's Choice",https://www.facebook.com/391475237597709,3.91475E+14,https://web.facebook.com/HillaryClintonThePeoplesChoice/posts/1241590195919538,"""Six senators from both parties introduced a bill on Wednesday that would prevent President Donald Trump from easing sanctions on Russia without congressional approval.
The Russia Sanctions Review Act of 2017 would require the Trump administration to describe in detail for Congress any proposed sanctions relief. The administration would then have to demonstrate that the Russian government had stopped supporting significant acts intended to undermine the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine and ended all cyberattacks against the U.S. government or individual Americans.
Both houses of Congress would then have 120 days to reject the proposed sanctions relief, or otherwise take action on them, before the reductions in sanctions came into effect.
Republican Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.) joined Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Claire McCaskill (Mo.) and Ben Cardin (Md.) in co-sponsoring the bill.
To provide relief at this time would send the wrong signal to Russia and our allies who face Russian oppression, Graham said in a statement. Sanctions relief must be earned, not given.
The United States levied sanctions against Russia in 2014 for its intervention in Ukraine, when it annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and subsequently provided support to pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. The Obama administration levied additional sanctions against the country in December for its alleged interference in the American election.
Among congressional Republicans, McCain, Rubio and Graham have perhaps been the most openly critical of Trumps suggestions that he is open to warmer relations with Moscow.
Trump has shocked many observers with his relative unwillingness to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, including Russias military aggression against Ukraine. The presidents conciliatory approach to Russia has also raised questions about his possible conflicts of interest, since U.S. intelligence agencies believe Putins government hacked Democratic emails in an effort to bolster Trumps presidential candidacy.
It is not clear, however, if the Trump administration plans to ease either set of sanctions against Russia.""",Public Figure,,,,,"205,497","206,809",,,

Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) on Thursday called for a ""total and complete shutdown"" on legislation advancing President Trump's agenda in light of reports of possible coordination between his campaign and Moscow.
The accusation followed a CNN report claiming that several U.S. officials believe that the FBI has information that suggests possible coordination between President Trump's associates and suspected Russian operatives during the 2016 election aimed at releasing hacked information to damage Hillary Clinton.
The bombshell revelation that U.S. officials have information that suggests Trump associates may have colluded with the Russians means we must pause the entire Trump agenda. We may have an illegitimate President of the United States currently occupying the White House, Lieu said in a statement.
Other than allowing routine governmental functions, there must be a total and complete shutdown of any agenda item being pushed by the Trump Administration. Congress cannot continue regular order and must stop voting on any Trump-backed agenda item until the FBI completes its Trump-Russia collusion investigation.""
Lieu urged Congress to appoint a special prosecutor and form an independent commission in order to investigate the alleged contacts ""with impartiality and independence.""
""Congress also needs to pass the Resolution of Inquiry, authored by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and I, to compel the Trump Administration to publicly disclose information on its Russian ties to the American people,"" the lawmaker maintained.
""At this point in our nation's history, there is nothing more important than finding out whether or not high crimes were committed by associates of Donald Trump or possibly by Trump himself, he added.","Away

""First of all, Russia isnt interested in taking over the world.
""Vladimir Putin isnt even interested in reconstituting the Soviet Union.
""Administering a lot of new territory is more of a headache than its worth. The only spit of land that Russia has actually absorbed, the Crimean peninsula, has been a drain on the Russian budget, and the exclave has seen very little of the prosperity Russia promised. The other parts of the near abroad locked in frozen conflicts  South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Transnistria  are no great shakes economically either.
""The Kremlin is content to have a secure perimeter free from NATO interference. Of course, given NATOs perennial interest in expanding eastward, a basic conflict lies at the heart of East-West relations. Until the two sides come up with a disengagement agreement, Eastern Europe will continue to be a zone of contention, with poor Ukraine split in half like a cheap piata.
""Putin is really more concerned about economic matters.
""When oil prices dropped, the Russian economy quickly went south as the GDP per capita suffered an astounding drop from $15,000 in 2014 to only $9,000 one year later. U.S. sanctions, imposed after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, certainly didnt help matters. Since then, Russia has boosted oil production and taken advantage of a rise in prices. Modest growth has returned. Lifting U.S. sanctions would add as much as .2 percent to Russian growth in 2017 and .5 percent in 2018. Thats actually a lot of rubles.
""Putin no doubt welcomed Trumps hints that he would lift sanctions, cooperate with Russia against the Islamic State, and downplay U.S. concerns for human rights around the world. But Trump was never a reliable patsy.
""For one thing, he wasnt reliable, period. For another, he backed positions that would ultimately conflict with Russia, such as his promise to undo the nuclear agreement with Iran. If Russia were indeed behind the hack of the DNC  even if its proved to have funneled money into the election on Trumps side  Im not convinced that Putin ever expected Trump to win. As a canny politician, the Russian leader also would have anticipated that if Trump did manage to beat the odds, he would have to contend with a foreign policy establishment that is far from Russia-friendly.
""So, more likely, Putin simply wanted to throw the American political system into turmoil. He was hoping for, at best, a legitimation crisis that would hobble any incoming administration and make it that much more difficult for the United States to act in the world.
""As it happened, Trump won on a long shot, and the American political system has indeed been thrown into turmoil as a result of it. U.S. policy toward Russia hasnt really changed. The sanctions remain in place, Washington still expects Russia to pull out of eastern Ukraine and give back Crimea, and the usual criticisms of Russian conduct prevail at the United Nations. As with everything to do with policy, Trump was winging it. Once in power, he has fallen back on the status quo ante.
""But heres the interesting part. Theres good reason to believe that, despite all the hoopla in Moscow over Trumps victory, Russia took the first steps to begin to undermine the new administration. It was only two days after the election, after all, that the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov contradicted the claim of the Trump campaign that it hadnt maintained contact with Russian officials.
""Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak also confirmed that meetings took place, though he also sought to normalize them by saying that they happen all the time with political figures. Thats true, of course, but the Trump campaign was busy denying that theyd transpired in the first place.
""So, perhaps Russia didnt really expect that Trump would keep his word. Confirming that the meetings did in fact take place helped fulfill the underlying objective of destabilizing the American political system.
""And now, what can Trump do? Admitting that hes been played by Moscow would bring his administration crashing down around his head (not to mention damaging his ego). He can continue to lie, and ask his team to do the same, but only so many loyal adjutants can fall on their swords before all the blood on the floor makes governance impossible.
""So, Trump did the only thing he knew how to do: make things up. His claim that the Obama administration was spying on him  a Watergate-sized accusation  suddenly had the media in a tizzy trying to find substantiation. In a reasonable world, Trumps latest tweets would be his Milo moment when everyone realizes that, like the ludicrous pundit Milo Yiannopoulos, Trump is truly unhinged. Milos book contract can be rescinded, but its not so easy to take away Trumps presidency.
""The Future Impact of Russiagate
""Donald Trumps presidential campaign was plagued by one scandal after another. But none of the gaffes and revelations and embarrassments seemed to end Trumps political career.
""Russiagate is different. First of all, Trump is now an elected figure, not just a cartoonish candidate. Second, this scandal involves much higher stakes than insulting John McCains war record or mocking a disabled reporter. Laws might have been broken; national security might have been breached; an election might have been compromised.
""Pursuing an investigation into Trumps possible misdeeds may have any number of unanticipated consequences. But it is not likely to precipitate a new Cold War with Russia. Such a development depends more on NATO policy in Eastern Europe, Russian actions in its near abroad, and imponderables such as the course of the war in Syria and petropolitics in Europe.
""I have lots of reasons to criticize Vladimir Putin and his attempt to push a far right-wing agenda at home and abroad. But its absolutely critical to separate ones views about Putin and Kremlin policies from an investigation into Donald Trumps misconduct. Let me repeat: This is no witch-hunt. This is democracy in action in an effort to discover abuse of power.
""If the appointment of a special prosecutor doesnt attract bipartisan support, I will be unhappy but unsurprised. But everyone to the left of Ann Coulter should be on board. If ever there were a time for unity, it is now.""

Otherwise apparently intelligent people are encouraging this phenomenon, subscribing to the silliness and, essentially, refusing to accept an election result they don't like.
The latest is the attempt to pile on to Trump for calling out John Lewis. Now Leftists are saying they'll boycott the inauguration in solidarity with Lewis. Well, I don't think it matters who boycotts the inauguration - it simply reflects poorly on the losers if they refuse to turn up for the awarding of the ultimate prize - but to suggest Lewis is the aggrieved party here is absurd, he is an elected official who openly declared the president-elect did not legitimately win the election.

A MUST TO READ AND SHARE.
Post from Dorothy Wong: Not my words but, the oil goes deeper. Here are more facts with sources to support your concerns. The Dakota Access Pipeline, Keystone XL, the selling of national parks, Russia hacking our elections and Trump's cabinet is part of a larger grand plan. Let's put this all together, shall we?
1)Exxon has a $500 Billion dollar deal with Russia currently shelved due to US sanctions from Russia invading the Ukraine. Rex Tillerson, former Exxon CEO has been named Trump's Secretary of State. A position that gives him & Trump the power to remove the sanction and move the project with Putin (whom Rex has had a relationship with for years) forward. https://www.nytimes.com//rex-tillersons-company-exxon-has-
2)Then we have Rick Perry as Trumps Energy Secretary. Perry is on the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer Partners that owns the Dakota Access Pipeline that protesters are fighting hard to stop building through Native American reservation land. Why would Trump appoint him to this position? Answer: Rick Perry now has full government power to build his pipeline anyway he wants that suits his $3.75 billion credit line to Energy Transfer Partners investment. Energy Transfer Partners recently said in their financial forecast that theyre perfectly positioned to take advantage of new laws allowing shipping export of oil from the US. Recently, Trump immediately pushes the pipeline forward (however the Swedish bank backing the project has promised to divest immediately if this goes forward, but many other banks still back it). Trump himself owned stock in the pipeline until very recently. Supposedly he has now divested, or turned the stock over to a family trust.
http://www.cnbc.com//trump-energy-dept-pick-rick-perry-sit
3) Republican Senate Majority Leader McConnell is accused of attempting to keep Russian interference in the election quiet. Why? Republican Senate Majority Leader McConnell is married to Trump's Dept. of Transportation, Secretary Elaine Chao whose family is worth billions in the shipping industry. Why would she want to be part of this? Answer: She would oversee the regulation of the United States' maritime resources, and possibly be able to bend federal regulations to accommodate her family's business. This gives her power to ship the massive amounts of oil from the Dakota Access Pipeline and from ExxonMobile from all the new drilling sites Trump, Rex, and Russia approves. http://fortune.com/2016/11/29/donald-trump-elaine-chao/
4) Why would Trump appoint Oklahoma Attorney General, Scott Pruitt to be the Head of the EPA(Environmental Protection Agency)? Answer: Scott Pruitts current court case against the EPA over what he considers to be overly strict pollution standards would be invalid once he gets the power to change those standards and loosen them so that Rex Tillerson of Exxon can drill all over the world for Russia, Rick Perry of Energy Transfer Partners can pipe oil through Native American lands through the Dakota Access Pipeline, and Republican Senate Majority Leader McConnell and his wife, Dept. of Transportation, Secretary Elaine Chaos family can ship it all
over the world.
https://www.washingtonpost.com//trump-names-scott-pruitt-/
5) On the 1st week of January, the GOP majority in the House of Representatives out voted the Democrats and passed a bill to devalued public lands & buildings (parks & wilderness) to be worth $0 so that they can sell it, which benefit$ oil & mining companies. Yosemite National Park & federal buildings like FBI J. Edgar Hoover headquarters building could ALL be given away at tax payers expense. That bill has been repeal, but new similar ones are re-introduced.
http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com//republicans_in_c
6) Then within minutes of the inaugeration, the White House puts up its ""Energy First"" statement under the ""issues"" section with his administration's plans to MINE and DRILL our PARKS and does not allow any area on the website where the people can send feedback about our disapproval. This is the statement, ""We must TAKE ADVANTAGE OF the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on FEDERAL LANDS that the AMERICAN PEOPLE OWN."" The whole point of congress passing a bill to devalue public lands to $0 is to make it an instant profit for the oil and mining companies to start working on breaking up our national parks as quickly as possible without any red tape that was once there before when they had to estimate the value of the land to the budget committee. Many of Trump's cabinet members are already billionaires and they have interest in politics to further their investments in these oil and mining companies.
https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy
Plus, the ""energy first"" initiative in the White House website says the administration wants to start a COAL INDUSTRY AS a solution to CLEAN ENERGY. REALLY? After sending 13 million green energy jobs to China instead of keeping it in the US where it could easily go to the jobless Midwest that has the land and labor to house solar panels and instead intends to resell that clean energy back to Americans. As other countries grow wealthy with green energy such as solar power, he proposes ""coal"".
[http://usuncut.com//trump-cede-13-million-jobs-china-one-/. This source has been taken down]. http://time.com/4447586/trump-coal-industry-energy/
The Trump administration has set-up the perfect scenario for depleting the Earth of archaic resources for oil that we no longer need. Instead, we should be utilizing advancements of green energy solutions like the rest of the world. This situation also sets up the potential for devastating Artic drilling in the very near future, which fortunately, the Obama administration put a new ban on all future Artic drilling before he left office. Yet, since Trump reversed Obama's executive order to stop the pipeline project, then he may also reverse the ban on artic drilling so that Rex can get back to his projects there. With climate change being a real thing, the pollution would swim all over.
While Trump plays his magic show of bringing out the hate and bigotry amongst Americans to fight amongst each other like an episode of American Apprentice, his true intentions are to get his treasonous friends to drill the Earth of its oil with no environmental standards. This will make him and his friends trillions. What will we have left when the anger from the Trump voters and everyone else subside, a devastated Earth, all because some American citizens got caught up with Trumps magic antics of a wall around Mexico that he says Mexico will pay for, a Muslim registry for internment camps, overturning abortion rights that can bring back coat hanger, back-alley abortions, normalizing Nazis (alt-right, white nationalists) and all the surface level conservative arguments over the decades. Look over here, fight, fight, but DONT EVER LOOK OVER HERE where the real devastation will happen behind your backs. If youre reading this and understand that this will affect everyone all over the world, then hold Trump and his cabinet accountable.

This goes to the core of what it means to be a role model for over 300 million Americans. This goes to the core of understanding the role of competing institutions in a democracy. At this point, his supporters must ask themselves if the particular policy/position/belief that attracted them to Mr. Trump is worth the collateral damage to our country and to the world.
In case youve been busy with work or napping or on vacation or in a gin-induced coma to avoid reality, heres a summary of President Trumps first month. He is President of the United States; heretofore the greatest nation in the world, the sole remaining superpower, the beacon of hope for oppressed people around the globe. Lets review:
Raid on Yemen..not so great
Immigrant bandoesnt tell appropriate agencies, other countries, or Republican leaders in House or Senate..causes chaos.overturned by three separate courts.not so well-planned
North Korean missile test.president responds by turning Mar-a-Lago into a Situation Room..with cell phones out and regular citizens present violating all norms of protocol and security
General Flynn..playing footsie with the Russians before the inauguration.commits what could be considered an act of treason.gets caught and thrown under the busmore to come on that
Multiple campaign staff found to have had similar, disconcerting chats with members of Russian intelligence agencies during the campaign.certainly more to come on that
Routinely tweets with all the angst and petulance of an angry middle school kidteaching students all across the nation that the way for a powerful person to deal with frustration is to demean people on social media. Some tweets directly attack U.S. citizens, like Chuck Jones, president of a local Steelworkers Union.
Repeated Freudian outbursts distorting the size of his inauguration crowd.technically called inauguration envy
Bashes Obamacare for years, promises perfect replacementeveryone gets a free pony..now recognizes the impossibility of that task..protests occur across the country from those who are afraid to lose coverage..suddenly starts talking about repair rather than repeal,..makes it obvious that the previous administration actually wasnt totally inept
Launches personal attacks on individual judges, including a Republican appointed by George W. Bushintentionally trying to undermine our free and independent judiciary, the bedrock of our democracynot working particularly well. Judge Gorsuch, his conservative nominee for the Supreme Court, calls the attacks disheartening.
Insults our neighbor and one of our biggest trading partners by announcing plans to build a wall along the border, even though data shows more people cross the border from the U.S. into Mexico than in the other direction.13-20 billion price tag..even security experts say a limited fence is better than a wall as it allows a view of the other side
Continues to attack individual businesses on Twitter.most recently Nordstrom for dropping Ivankas products due to lack of sales
Kellyanne Conwayalternative facts..buy Ivanka..suddenly her pitbull persona seems a little less fierce
Makes claims about massive voter fraud (3-5 million illegal votes) that are discredited by Republicans and Democrats alikeit simply didnt happen but he believes it to be so
Alienates the Prime Minister of Australia, also a long-time U.S. allyso bad that Senator McCain intercedes to apologize
Needs his vice-president to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate to confirm his Secretary of Education, perhaps the least qualified person ever nominated for that positionmany Republican Senators know that but beating up on teachers/education/public schools plays well their base and they dont want to anger a president who may call them out on Twitter
Makes bold announcement saying wed move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem..going against many years of Republican and Democratic presidents.has an epiphany a few weeks later about the complexities of that issuestarts walking back the language showing once again that the previous administration was not as dumb as he claimed.
Pilloried his opponent for taking money for a private speech made to Goldman-Sachs employees..promised to drain the swampthen hired a slew of Goldman-Sachs leaders to be on his economic and finance team
Has a White House staff with so many power centers that leaks are coming faster than the media can print them. The common theme is chaos, disorder, complete lack of plan or vision.
Gets played by Stephen Bannon who nudges him to sign an unread executive order that puts the aforementioned alt-right personna on the National Security Council..his presence is not appreciated by generals and other experts in the group
Alienates the entire national intelligence apparatus, normally considered solidly conservative, due to not liking their fact-based report about Russian hackinginsults the agencies by going on an egomaniacal riff in front a monument to intelligence agents who died in the line of duty
Stephen Bannon..tells the media to Shut up,..along with presidential tweets decrying credible, mainstream news sources as fake news, part of a plan to discredit our free and independent press, another pillar of democracymedia catching on and calling the administration out on their lies frequently and boldly
Sean Spicer.a parody so funny that you dont need a skit on SNLbut Melissa McCarthy made him the laughingstock of the nation
Republicans in the House and Senatethat control all three branches of federal governmentcant quite get around to writing a new health care plan or developing a new tax planbut gosh they certainly can vote to allow mentally ill people to buy firearms. This comes after proclaiming for years that we dont need reasonable gun control, just better mental health care..a show of such cowardice and hypocrisy its unbelievable even by NRA standards.
Nominates Andrew Pudzer for Secretary of Labor..a man so antithetical to the labor movement that his nomination couldnt get through Senateso much for fighting for the little guy. Kudos to some brave Republican Senators who didn't support him.
Im sure there are others but you get the gist. At what point do his moderate supporters feel buyers remorse and admit that Mr. Trump has neither the skill set nor the temperament to lead our country? Please let it be soon.",,,,,,,,,,

And yet, the Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian activity in the election found that this was but the most recent and aggressive expression to date of a longstanding Russian desire to sow chaos and instability in the United States. Russias meddling in the 2016 election should be a wake-up call to every American about the diverse ways in which Russian malicious cyberactivity could affect every aspect of their lives.
The so-called information warfare campaign ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election is part-and-parcel of a longstanding and multi-faceted Russian intelligence strategy that blends covert intelligence operationssuch as cyberactivitywith overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or trolls in order to cripple its adversaries. The election is not the first time Russian cyberactors have been successful. Over the past decade, Russian hacking groupsmany of which are backed by the governmenthave successfully deployed a technology-based strategy to infiltrate, tamper with, and steal sensitive information across government, military, banking, and communications systems in the United States and Europe.
[....]
Given the examples provided here of Russian hacking, both in the United States and abroad, it is clear that there needs to be a more thorough approach to understanding, preventing, and responding to cyberattacks across all sectors. The United States and Europe are plainly vulnerable to cyberattacks, and as the world continues to become more reliant upon electronic systems, these vulnerabilities will only grow.
In order to better understand the specific attacks outlined here, there must be a deeper investigation into Russias cyberabilities, specifically regarding their involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. To better prevent and respond to cyberattacks, U.S. government agencies, as well as other industries such as banking and finance, must develop comprehensive strategies for identifying, preventing, and responding to cyberattacks. It is also important to remember that these attacks are not only against institutions; they are also against ordinary citizens. Even when these attacks directly impact the government, there is a cost to all Americans. Russian hacking is a threat to American democracy and privacy rights. It cannot go unanswered.""",Public Figure,,,,,"205,497","206,809",,,

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) on Thursday took a swipe at Trump. Who benefits from a president-elect trashing the intelligence community? she said, adding, Who actually is the benefactor?
Clapper replied that there is an important distinction here between healthy skepticism, which policymakers, to include policymaker number one, should always have for intelligence, but I think there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement.
Former CIA director R. James Woolsey Jr., a veteran of four presidential administrations, resigned Thursday from Trumps transition team because of growing tensions over Trumps vision for intelligence agencies.
Clapper noted that while much of the public focus over the past six months has been on Russian hacking of Democratic Party organizations, the Russian campaign of fake news, often promoted on social media, should not be overlooked. He pointed to Russia Today, also known as RT, a Russian-government-funded international television network that Clapper said is pushing a point of view disparaging our system, our alleged hypocrisy about human rights. Whether it was RT, use of social media, fake news, he said, they exercised all of those capabilities in addition to the hacking.
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who was Clintons running mate, said he was the subject of several fake news stories. The mainstream media ignored them, he said, but one of the stories was shared 800,000 times. Some originated within the United States.
He then took a jab at Trumps pick for national security adviser, Flynn, a former military intelligence officer who has drawn criticism from some former colleagues for his strident support of Trump. Without mentioning Flynns name, Kaine alluded to Flynn sharing on Twitter a baseless story claiming that members of Clintons campaign were engaged in a child prostitution ring. Flynn, who has not responded to questions about the story, has since deleted the tweet. Still, Kaine decried an administration that has put in place as the proposed national security adviser someone who traffics in these fake news stories and retweets them and shares them . . . stories that most fourth-graders would find incredible.",,,,,,,,,,

Stephanie Vardavas,https://www.facebook.com/818375256,818375256,https://web.facebook.com/vardavas/posts/10158352133950257,">>As a Presidential candidate, Donald Trump led a charmed existence. Whatever he said, no matter how outrageous, it didnt seem to hurt him. He could insult his Republican opponents, make misogynistic comments about female journalists, call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, describe Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, trot out blatant falsehoods by the dozen, encourage the Russians to hack Hillary Clintons e-mail accountnone of it proved damaging to his candidacy. As he famously remarked, it was as if he could go out and shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and I wouldnt lose voters.
Now things have changed. He might never admit it, but Trump has belatedly discovered a basic principle of politics: words matter. They matter so much, in fact, that they can make or break a Presidency. Thats why every one of his predecessorsduring the modern era, at leasthas chosen his words carefully. It took a few weeks for it to become clear that President Trump, as opposed to candidate Trump, would be subject to this principle. But, at this stage, there can be no doubt about it. Virtually every day brings a fresh example of his own loose words coming back to hurt him.
Take the legal setback to the Administrations revised travel ban, which was supposed to go into effect on Thursday. Derrick Kahala Watson, the federal judge in Hawaii who, on Wednesday, halted the measure on constitutional grounds, said that the public record includes significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus driving the promulgation of the Executive Order. Among other things, Watson cited a Trump campaign document that said, Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. On Thursday, another federal judge, Theodore D. Chuang, of Maryland, issued a separate injunction against the revised ban. Citing statements from Trump and his advisers, Chuang said that they indicated the new executive order represented the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban. (My colleagues Benjamin Wallace-Wells and Jeffrey Toobin have more about both judges orders.)
It doesnt stop there. As Slates Mark Joseph Stern has pointed out, even a staunchly conservative judge who has taken the Administrations side in the fight over the travel bans has criticized some of Trumps public statements. Earlier this week, in a dissent from a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling against the original ban, Judge Jay Bybee strongly condemned the Presidents attacks on James Robart, the district-court judge in Seattle who originally halted the ban. (On Twitter, Trump had referred to Robart as a so-called judge and called his ruling ridiculous.)
The personal attacks on the distinguished district judge and our colleagues were out of all bounds of civic and persuasive discourseparticularly when they came from the parties, Bybee, who worked in the George W. Bush Administration, wrote. Such personal attacks treat the court as though it were merely a political forum in which bargaining, compromise, and even intimidation are acceptable principles. The courts of law must be more than that, or we are not governed by law at all.
So far, then, the words that Trump has used to bully and berate the judiciary have succeeded only in encouraging judges to display their independence, with disastrous results for his Administration. And something similar has happened in response to his effort to divert attention from his Russia woes by accusing his predecessor, Barack Obama, of bugging Trump Tower.
Two weeks ago, in a series of early morning tweets, Trump declared that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! Perhaps he thought that no one would interrogate his words. Or perhaps he wasnt thinking at all. In any case, the White House spokesman Sean Spicer later compounded the error by calling on Congress to investigate Trumps charges. The House and Senate intelligence committees did what Spicer asked, and on Thursday the heads of the Senate committeethe Republican Richard Burr and the Democrat Mark Warnerissued a joint statement that said, Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016.
After that, you might have thought that Trump and his aides would decide to exercise a bit more caution in what they said. Not a bit of it. At his daily briefing on Thursday afternoon, Spicer said that the President stands by his bugging accusations. By way of trying to prove that these accusations were reasonable, Spicer also read out some comments made by Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commentator, in which Napolitano claimed, without citing any evidence, that Obama had asked G.C.H.Q., Britains version of the National Security Agency, to bug Trump.
Spicers briefing created yet more embarrassment for the White House. G.C.H.Q. issued a rare public statement, in which it said that Napolitanos claims were utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. In response to reporters inquiries, a spokesman for Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, repeated the word nonsense, and added, We have made this clear to the administration, and have received assurances that these allegations will not be repeated. On Friday morning, there were reports, subsequently denied by Trump aides, that the United States had issued a formal apology to Britain.
What cant be denied is that, yet again, the White House is in the soup. The President and his aides now know that words and truth do matter. Yet they continue to act as if they are oblivious. At a press conference with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, on Friday afternoon, a German reporter asked Trump, Why do you keep saying things you know are not true? Trump didnt answer directly. When another German reporter asked Trump about the White House citing claims that the British government bugged him, he refused to take responsibility. We said nothing, he said. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didnt make an opinion on it. And, once again, Trump refused to back off the discredited claim that Obama bugged him. Looking at Merkel, whose phone the N.S.A. reportedly tapped for years, he said, jokingly, At least we have something in common, perhaps.
Of course, its no joke. But will he ever learn?<<",,,,,,,," Parkville, Maryland",,

The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions. If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted.
There is an active FBI investigation into these matters, and revelations may emerge any moment. But Congressional investigations in the House and Senate have been slow, under-resourced, and mired in partisan politics. Many Congressional leaders have called for an independent investigation, a special prosecutor or a commission to fairly investigate these concerns. Despite the clear will of the people, their calls have not been answered.
Therefore, we call for a #MarchForTruth to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that Americans want answers. The legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the Presidency.
Across the country, peaceful demonstrations will be arranged on Saturday, June 3rd. Our goals are simple:
1. A special prosecutor must be named and Congressional investigations must be fully resourced.;
2. As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible;
3. Donald Trump should release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity;
4. If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.
We need help. We are asking cities around the country to organize. We are looking for volunteers to help secure permits, find speakers, and take care of the logistics to make this peaceful assembly matter. Email marchfortruth@gmail.com for more information.","Typically replies within an hour

""Liberals in my life keep asking me when Im going to stop picking on the Democratic establishment and start helping them beat up on Trump. Lately Ive just been replying along the lines of, Uhh, maybe when you people stop acting like stark raving lunatics? When you reverse your lycanthropic transformation into a bunch of red-faced Joe McCarthys and become the sensible good-hearted people I used to think you are? When you stop acting like a return to Cold War-era tensions with a nuclear superpower is somehow preferable to addressing the horrific injustices unveiled in the WikiLeaks documents? You guys live in a country with a political system that cannibalizes any candidate who looks like they might actually help the ninety-nine percent and youre asking me when Ill join the vast legion of commentators already relentlessly criticizing Trump?? This is nuts. Youre nuts. I need whiskey.
So far, though, theyre only getting crazier. The other day I wrote an article where I pointed out that the way corporate media keeps deliberately marrying the words election and hacking is probably going to succeed in making people start believing that the Russian government actively hacked voting machines to flip votes from Clinton to Trump. I wasnt aware of this at the time, but a mid-December YouGov poll had already found that half of Clinton voters believed that to be the case, answering true when asked if Russian hackers tampered with vote tallies to help Donald Trump. This was before news outlets really started ramping up on that particularly insidious psy-op in response to Obamas new sanctions; AFP recently ran a story where the headline actually called it vote hacking, so theyre getting even bolder now.
It is not an accident that liberals believe this. As a result of consistently marrying the words Saddam Hussein with 9/11, corporate media succeeded in convincing seventy percent of the American public that Saddam was involved in the September 11th attacks in order to rally support for the Iraq invasion. The United States government officially made it legal to conduct psy-ops on American citizens in 2012, so they dont even need to worry about WikiLeaks publishing evidence of government insiders colluding with the media to deceive the public; what they are doing is now completely legal. The end of 2016 also saw the dissolution of the board responsible for keeping government surveillance in check and the passage of a new bill to allot funds toward government propaganda, so we can only expect things to get even more Orwellian.""

Rather it may have been Richard Nixons secret efforts in 1968 to sabotage a U.S. diplomatic effort to end the Vietnam War.
Nixons initiative, long rumored but confirmed only a few months ago, was meant to improve his election chances that year. After Nixon won, the war dragged on and cost thousands of additional American and Vietnamese lives; its hard to see his behavior as anything but treason.
Now the F.B.I. confirms that we have had an investigation underway for eight months into whether another presidential campaign colluded with a foreign power so as to win an election. To me, that, too, would amount to treason.
Ive been speaking to intelligence experts, Americans and foreigners alike, and they mostly (but not entirely) believe there was Trump-Russia cooperation of some kind. But this is uncertain; its prudent to note that James Clapper, the intelligence director under Barack Obama, said that as of January he had seen no evidence of collusion but that he favors an investigation to get to the bottom of it.
Im also told (not by a Democrat!) that theres a persuasive piece of intelligence on ties between Russia and a member of the Trump team that isnt yet public.
The most likely scenario for collusion seems fuzzier and less transactional than many Democrats anticipate. A bit of conjecture:
The Russians for years had influence over Donald Trump because of their investments with him, and he was by nature inclined to admire Vladimir Putin as a strongman ruler. Meanwhile, Trump had in his orbit a number of people with Moscow ties, including Paul Manafort, who practically bleeds borscht.

Photo by: Damon Winter/The New York Times
The Associated Press reports that Manafort had secretly worked for a Russian billionaire close to Putin, signing a $10-million-a-year contract in 2006 to promote the interests of the Putin government. The arrangement lasted at least until 2009.
As The A.P. puts it, Manafort offered to influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government. (Manafort told The A.P. that his work was being falsely portrayed as nefarious.)
This is guesswork, but it might have seemed natural for Trump aides to try to milk Russian contacts for useful information about the Clinton campaign. Likewise, the Russians despised Hillary Clinton and would have been interested in milking American contacts for information about how best to damage her chances.
At some point, I suspect, members of the Trump team gained knowledge of Russian hacking into Clinton emails, which would explain why Trump friend Roger Stone tweeted things like Trust me, it will soon the Podestas time in the barrel.
This kind of soft collusion, evolving over the course of the campaign without a clear quid pro quo, might also explain why there werent greater efforts to hide the Trump teams ties to Russia, or to camouflage its softening of the Republican Party platform position toward Moscow.
One crucial unknown: Did Russia try to funnel money into Trumps campaign coffers? In European elections, Russia has regularly tried to influence results by providing secret funds. Im sure the F.B.I. is looking into whether there were suspicious financial transfers.
The contacts with Russia are by Trumps aides, and the challenge will be to connect any collusion to the president himself. The White House is already distancing itself from Manafort, claiming that he played only a very limited role in the campaign  even though he was Trumps campaign chairman!
Many Democrats are, I think, too focused on Jeff Sessions and have too transactional a view of what may have unfolded. Treason isnt necessarily spelled out as a quid pro quo, and it wasnt when Nixon tried to sink the Vietnam peace initiative in 1968.
In the past, as when foreign funds made their way into Bill Clintons 1996 re-election campaign, Republicans showed intense interest in foreign interference in the political process. So its sad to see some Republicans (I mean you, Devin Nunes!) trying to hijack todays House investigation to make it about leaks.
Really? Our country was attacked by Russia, and youre obsessed with leaks? Do you honestly think that the culprit in Watergate wasnt Nixon but the famed leaker Deep Throat? Republicans should replace Nunes as head of the House Intelligence Committee; he cant simultaneously be Trumps advocate and his investigator.
The fundamental question now isnt about Trumps lies, or intelligence leaks, or inadvertent collection of Trump communications. Rather, the crucial question is as monumental as it is simple: Was there treason?
We dont know yet what unfolded, and raw intelligence is often wrong. But the issue cries out for a careful, public and bipartisan investigation by an independent commission.

""Gibbs: Let us turn to the role of the media in reporting alleged Russian interference in the US electoral process. Mainstream journalists have called Trump a puppet of Russia, a modern version of the Manchurian Candidate. Others have criticized the media for accepting unsubstantiated claims about Russian influence, and reporting such claims as facts. Norman Solomon and Serge Halimi, for example, stated that press reporting on this issue amounts to a mass hysteria reminiscent of the McCarthy era, while Seymour Hersh called the media reporting on Russia outrageous.[iii] What is your view of this situation?
Chomsky: My guess is that most of the world is just collapsing in laughter. Suppose all the charges are true, I mean every single one, it is so amateurish by US standards that you can hardly even laugh. What the US does is the kind of thing I described in Italy in 1948. Case after case like that, not hacking or spreading rumors in the media; but saying look, were going to starve you to death or kill you or destroy you unless you vote the way we want. I mean thats what we do.
Take the famous 9/11, lets think about it for a minute. It was a pretty awful terrorist act. It could have been a lot worse. Now lets suppose that instead of the plane being downed in Pennsylvania by passengers, suppose it had hit its target, which was probably the White House. Now suppose it had killed the president. Suppose that plans had been set for a military coup to take over the government. And right away, immediately 50,000 people were killed, 700,000 tortured. A bunch of economists were brought in from Afghanistan, lets call them the Kandahar Boys, who very quickly destroyed the economy, and established a dictatorship which devastated the country. That would have been a lot worse than 9/11. It happened: the first 9/11, it happened on September 11, 1973, in Chile. We did it. Was that interfering or hacking a party? This record is all over the world, constantly overthrowing governments, invading, forcing people to follow what we call democracy, as in the cases I mentioned. As I say, if every charge is accurate, its a joke, and Im sure half the world is collapsing in laughter about this, because people outside the United States know it.

""The idea originated from a group of computer scientists represented by attorney John Bonifaz, who after analyzing the U.S. computerized voting system found it to be vulnerable to hacking and manipulation. Social scientists and statisticians deemed some of the 2016 election results to be improbable. Election integrity volunteers and attorneys stepped up to help sort it out.
Jill Stein, Green Party presidential candidate, agreed to ask for recounts in three states: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The donation page went online the afternoon before Thanksgiving. The recount was quickly financed in a few weeks by 150,000 small donors at the grassroots level across the political spectrum.
But if you were watching Fox News or reading Facebook during the recount you would think Stein, with a suspicious and nefarious agenda, was at best working undercover for the Clinton campaign or at worst, involved in a political payola campaign scam to enrich herself.
In reality, she was using the U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency on International Development (USAID) standards of election integrity that every democratic country on the planet is held to  except the United States....""

If you include the office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which in 2005 began as a crew of 12 people, including its director, and by 2008 had already grown to a staff of 1,750, there are 17 members (adding up to an alphabet soup of acronyms including the CIA, the NSA, and the DIA). The IC spends something like $70 billion of your taxpayer dollars annually, mostly in secret, hires hundreds of thousands of private contractors from various warrior corporations to lend a hand, sucks up communications of every sort across the planet, runs a drone air force, monitors satellites galore, builds its agencies billion-dollar-plus headquarters and storage facilities, and does all of this, ostensibly, to provide the president and the rest of the government with the best information imaginable on whats happening in the world and what dangers the United States faces.
Since 9/11, expansion has been the name of its game, as the leading intelligence agencies gained ever more power, prestige, and the big bucks, while wrapping themselves in an unprecedented blanket of secrecy. Typically, in the final days of the Obama administration, the National Security Agency was given yet more leeway to share the warrantless data it scoops up worldwide (including from American citizens) with ever more members of the IC.
And oh yes, in the weeks leading up to the inauguration of Donald Trump, several of those intelligence outfits found themselves in a knock-down, drag-out barroom brawl with our new tweeter-in-chief (who has begun threatening to downsize parts of the IC) over the possible Russian hacking of an American election and his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the process, they have received regular media plaudits for their crucial importance to all of us, our security and safety, along with tweeted curses from the then-president-elect.
Let me lay my own cards on the table here.

by Stephen Lendman
April 26, 2017
Claims about Russian US election hacking were fabricated. No evidence exists suggesting it.
Accusations without it are groundless. Media scoundrels repeat them anyway, abandoning responsible journalism, serving as press agents for power.
Indisputable evidence proves America routinely interferes in elections worldwide. It ruthlessly wants independent governments toppled, pro-Western puppet regimes replacing them.
A longstanding joke asks why America never experienced a coup - because Washington has no US embassy.
Since the 19th century, the United States sought to impose its will on other countries, notably post-WW II, beginning with US aggression on North Korea.
Its been worst of all post-9/11, America at war at home and worldwide, a reality check indictment of a rogue state, historys worst by far - humanity threatened by possible nuclear annihilation.
On April 24, AP News headlined Researchers: Russia-linked hackers targeted Macron campaign - falsely accused by the Japanese anti-virus firm Trend Micro
Its digital chief Mounir Mahjoubi cited no evidence proving his claim because none exists. The accusation is fake. No Russian meddling in Frances election occurred.
Moscow categorically denies fabricated claims about it interfering in any nations elections - not Americas, not Frances or any others.
Accusations are bogus, part of longstanding Russia bashing. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed phony claims, saying (i)t resembles the accusations made by Washington, which to this day remain hollow, doing no honor to the people making them.
Trend Micros report is fake news, he stressed. Addressing the UN Committee on Information in New York, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakhavova urged the world body to establish a strategy for battling fake news and disinformation.
Russia will be ready to fully support this initiative which is extremely important for developing a healthy environment for news reporting, she stressed.
Western media fake news drowns out legitimate journalism. Disinformation substitutes for truth-telling, especially on key issues.
False accusations about Russian interference in Frances election creates the appearance of Macron want(ing) to follow in the steps of Hillary Clinton, a very dubious path, Zakharova said weeks earlier.
Russia bashing persists without letup, bilateral relations with Washington at a post-Cold War low.
Trump is as despicable as Obama, despite pledging better relations. Theyre dismal with no signs of improvement.

By John Shattuck December 16, 2016
A specter of treason hovers over Donald Trump. He has brought it on himself by dismissing a bipartisan call for an investigation of Russias hacking of the Democratic National Committee as a ridiculous political attack on the legitimacy of his election as president.
Seventeen US national intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded that Russia engaged in cyberwarfare against the US presidential campaign. The lead agency, the CIA, has reached the further conclusion that Russias hacking was intended to influence the election in favor of Trump.
Admiral Michael Rogers, director of the National Security Agency and commander of the US Cyber Command, has stated, This was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance. This was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily. This was a conscious effort by a nation state to attempt to achieve a specific effect. On Thursday, a senior intelligence official disclosed that there is substantial evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself authorized the cyberattack.
Why does Trump publicly reject these intelligence agency conclusions and the bipartisan proposal for a congressional investigation? As president-elect, he should have a strong interest in presenting a united front against Russias interference with the electoral process at the core of American democracy.
There are several possible explanations for Trumps position. They are not mutually exclusive. First, he may be trying to shore up his political standing before the Electoral College vote on Monday. Second, he may be attempting to undermine the credibility of US intelligence agencies in advance of his taking office so that he can intimidate them and have a freer hand in reshaping the intelligence product to suit his objectives. Third, he may be testing his ability to go over the heads of intelligence professionals and congressional critics and persuade the American public to follow his version of the truth about national security threats. And finally, he may be seeking to cover up evidence of involvement or prior knowledge by members of his campaign team or himself in the Russian cyberattack.
In each case the president-elect is inviting an interpretation that his behavior is treasonous. The federal crime of treason is committed by a person owing allegiance to the United States who . . . adheres to their enemies, giving them aid or comfort, and misprision of treason is committed by a person having knowledge of the commission of any treason [who] conceals and does not disclose the crime. By denigrating or seeking to prevent an investigation of the Russian cyberattack Trump is giving aid or comfort to an enemy of the United States, a crime that is enhanced if the fourth explanation applies  that he is in fact seeking to cover up his staffs or his own involvement in or prior knowledge of the attack.
There is no direct evidence that the president-elect was involved or knew in advance about the Russian governments actions. But the circumstances underscore the nations need for a full investigation.
Paul Manafort, Trumps former campaign manager, has had extensive political dealings with the Russian government. Trumps designate for National Security Adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, has appeared as a commentator for Russian state television and sat with Vladimir Putin at a Russian gala. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly praised Putin and took positions favorable to the Russian government. As reported by the New York Times, the president-elects son, Donald Trump Jr., told a real estate gathering in 2008 that Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets, adding, we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. Two days after the election, Russias deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabokov, was quoted by the Times as saying that there were contacts between Moscow and the Trump campaign, and that members of the campaign staff were staying in touch with Russian representatives.
In light of these circumstances, Trump should seek to clear the air by endorsing the proposed investigation of the Russian hacking scandal. For him to continue to deny Russias cyberattack and resist the investigation invites a specter of treason to hover over the president-elect.

It should also be noted that a Quinnipiac University poll just put Trumps approval rating at 37 percent.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TRUMP SAYS ""I THINK IT WAS RUSSIA THAT HACKED THE DNC""
(Full Article) - For the first time, President-elect Donald J. Trump concedes Russia likely meddled in the election. Mr. Trump says he will present a replacement for the Affordable Care Act very soon.
___________________________________________________________
Trump Concedes Russia Behind Election Interference
President-elect Trump conceded for the first time that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic institutions during the presidential election, saying at a news conference that, I think it was Russia  though a few minutes later he said perhaps it was another country.
But he vigorously denied the swirl of allegations about his behavior that was published online Tuesday, calling it fake news and praising Russian President Vladimir V. Putin for saying it was false. I respected the fact that he said that, Mr. Trump told reporters.
Its all fake news. Its phony stuff. It didnt happen, Mr. Trump said. It was gotten by opponents of ours. It was a group of opponents that got together. Sick people and they got together and put that crap together.
Asked what Mr. Trump would say to Mr. Putin, he responded, He shouldnt have done it. I dont believe he will be doing it more.
Mr. Trump disputed the allegations that he was involved in salacious behavior in a Russian hotel room, saying that he is always highly aware that there are cameras in the strangest places in hotel rooms when he travels around the world.
You cant see them and you wont know, he said. You better be careful or you will be watching yourself on nightly televisions.
It wasnt particularly presidential but it was surprising
President-elect Trump angrily accused CNN of being fake news as he repeatedly refused to take a question from Jim Acosta, the networks reporter at his news conference.
In a testy exchange between the two men, Mr. Acosta repeatedly asked for a question in order to respond to the president-elects accusations against the network. Mr. Trump angrily said, I am not going to give you a question. You are fake news.
Mr. Trump also lashed out at Buzzfeed News, which published a document of allegations Tuesday night, calling the news organization a failing pile of garbage and saying that I think they are going to suffer the consequences.
___________________________________________________________
Trump: Repeal and Replace Obamacare Immediately
Mr. Trump said he will present a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare almost simultaneously with the confirmation of Tom Price, his nominee to be secretary of health and human services.
Were going to be submitting as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan, Mr. Trump said. It will be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously.
Mr. Trump said that Republicans could sit back in 2017 and watch the health care system get much worse. He said that would lead Democrats to beg him and Republican lawmakers to make changes to the law.
But instead, he said Republicans will move quickly to repeal President Obamas health care law and immediately replace it with something that he said will be much better.
Were going to get health care taken care of in this country, he said. News conference begins with attack on some of news media
Top aides to President-elect Trump on Wednesday used the president-elects first news conference in two months to lash out at the media on Wednesday for its reporting on allegations of salacious behavior by Mr. Trump and connections to Russia by several of his advisers.
Vice President-elect Mike Pence called the reporting false and unsubstantiated and said the reporting can only be attributed to media bias and an attempt to demean the president elect and our incoming administration.
Sean Spicer, who will be press secretary in the next administration, accused Buzzfeed News, which published a 35-page document detailing the allegations, and CNN, which reported on its existence, of a sad and pathetic effort to get clicks.
But Mr. Trump, in opening comments at his news conference, praised other news organizations for declining to publish the document, saying his assessment of those organizations had just gone up a notch.
___________________________________________________________
How Trump Will Distance Himself From his Business
President-elect Trump, insisting he will not divest himself of his vast business empire as he prepares to assume the presidency, plans instead to turn over all of his business operations to a trust controlled by his two oldest sons and a longtime associate, top officials with his company said Wednesday.
He will donate to the United States government all profits from foreign government payments to his hotels, the officials said, describing the arrangements as voluntary measures taken to answer concerns about potential conflicts of interest that would allow Mr. Trump to focus on running the country.
The Trump Organization will also refrain from entering into any new deals with foreign partners, his legal advisers said, backing off from an earlier claim by Mr. Trump that his company would have no new deals of any kind during his presidency. Instead, the Trump enterprise will have to clear any new transactions with an ethics adviser to be chosen by the president-elect in coming days. That ethics adviser will vet them for potential conflicts, using a standard that his advisers said had not yet been agreed upon.
The long-promised specifics Mr. Trumps advisers provided on Wednesday left dozens of unanswered questions about whether or how the president-elect would avoid conflicts as commander in chief.
And they fell short of the recommendations of ethics experts in both parties who have said the only way for Mr. Trump to genuinely eliminate potential conflicts is to place all his real estate holdings and other business ventures in a blind trust over which neither he nor his family has any control, severing him entirely from the enterprise. The explanations also raised fresh questions about whether Mr. Trump could leave office with his financial holdings more valuable than when he entered the White House.
Top officials with Mr. Trumps company detailed the plans on condition of anonymity on Wednesday to avoid pre-empting a news conference the president-elect will hold later in the day at Trump Tower  his first in nearly six months.
___________________________________________________________
Trump Nominates Veterans Affairs Secretary
David J. Shulkin, the current undersecretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the head of its sprawling hospital system, will become the secretary of the beleaguered agency, President-elect Trump said Wednesday.
Mr. Trump made the comments during his first full news conference since being elected president two months ago and just nine days before moving into the White House. He answered questions from some of the more than 250 reporters crammed into the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan.
Even as Mr. Trump took questions in New York, his nominee for secretary of state was being grilled on Capitol Hill by lawmakers about his connections to Russia. And news continued to swirl regarding allegations about Mr. Trump presented by intelligence officials to the president-elect.
___________________________________________________________
A Defense on Twitter
From the moment the unsubstantiated but explosive intelligence report hit the internet, the questions arose: When and what would Mr. Trump tweet?
The initial volley came shortly after 8:15 p.m. on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday morning, the president-elect decided to press his war with the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee  and rely on for pressing matters of state.
He also seconded reports from Moscow that Russian government officials deny having any compromising material on Mr. Trump.
It is true that the Kremlin denied holding any material that it could use to blackmail the incoming president. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, told reporters: The Kremlin has no compromising dossier on Trump. Such information isnt consistent with reality and is nothing but an absolute fantasy.
Needless to say, Russian officials would not tell the world they had such information if it was meant for blackmail. Also needless to say, an election won with nearly three million votes fewer than your opponent was not won easily.
A Quinnipiac University poll on Tuesday put Mr. Trumps approval rating at 37 percent.
It should be an interesting news conference at Trump Tower on Wednesday morning.
___________________________________________________________
A Multipronged News Media Pushback
Mr. Trumps longtime lawyer and sometimes spokesman, Michael Cohen, issued his own Twitter defense, a possibly ill-advised reference to Page 18 of the dossier, which alleges a secret meeting between Mr. Cohen and Russian intelligence agents in Prague  not something the Trump team wants attention on.
On CNN on Wednesday, Jake Tapper reported that it was a different Michael Cohen who was in Prague last August. Which one and what his connection  if any  might be to Mr. Trump was left unsaid.
Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, took another tack. Asked by the late-night talk show host Seth Meyers about the briefing intelligence officials had given Mr. Trump on the matter, she said she was not aware that he had been briefed.
___________________________________________________________
A Problem for Trump: You Cant Unsee Something
Questions continue to swirl about the validity of the dossier alleging that Russian intelligence has deeply compromising material on the man who is about to be commander in chief. But its wide circulation has already had an impact.
On Tuesday night, Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, asked President Obama for a classified briefing on the compromising information Russia has obtained regarding President-elect Donald Trump.
On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committees interim chairwoman, Donna Brazile, pressed for a bipartisan, independent investigation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must allow the establishment of an independent bipartisan commission to immediately investigate the full range of foreign interference in the 2016 election and determine what we need to do to keep our democracy safe from foreign interference. As part of that investigation, the commission must investigate President-elect Trumps personal and financial ties to Russia, ties between his aides and Russia, and the existence of allegedly compromising material that has allegedly been obtained by Russia in order to blackmail him.
___________________________________________________________
McCain Confirms He Passed Dossier to F.B.I.
As the news media had previously reported, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, confirmed on Wednesday that he had received the disputed dossier late last year and passed it on to James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director.
Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the F.B.I. That has been the extent of my contact with the F.B.I. or any other government agency regarding this issue.

Key Republican on Health Care Repeal: Slow Down
Mr. Trump may be demanding an immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a simultaneous enactment of a Republican replacement  and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, may be concurring with that rush  but one senator is not on board. And he is an important one.
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, addressed the headlong rush on Tuesday night. The American people deserve health care reform thats done in the right way, for the right reasons, in the right amount of time, he said. Its not about developing a quick fix. Its about working toward long-term solutions that work for everyone.
That is significant. If, as expected, Congress passes parliamentary language in the coming days to protect repeal legislation from a Democratic filibuster, four committees will be empowered to draft the actual bill. Mr. Alexander leads one of those committees.

No definition of what constitutes propaganda and disinformation or national security interests is given. In practice, these words can mean anything the Center would like them to mean.
Supposedly, the Center will only be targeting propaganda from foreign sources.
